            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough my Perſonal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations to you are very many and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and may very well ſcrew me up to a very high ſtrain of gratitude; (and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I find my ſelf very ready in this particular to do you right, and to acknowledge my ſelf very much bound to you and
<pb facs="tcp:134641:3"/>your Family; yet) I muſt ſay, I honour you more for the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude you take in doing good to all, and promoting every good Deſign that comes within your reach, without the leaſt Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy: Orphans, and Minors, and ſuch as are deſtitute of help, to whom you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grudg'd neither pains nor coſt, will plead for you, I hope, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my Tongue or Pen can. There are none that know you, but muſt confeſs, how cloſe a Friend you are to Religion and Learning, and at what rates you would promote them. Surely it had been a Crime in
<pb facs="tcp:134641:3"/>me, having ſo good occaſion, to have conceal'd your Worth and Merits towards me, whom you have intruſted with your beſt Treaſure, and given me all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and help to their good Education, not regarding the Slanders of ſome that would make themſelves ſeem wiſer in ſuch Affairs, wherein they have been little vers'd, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of far greater experience. I know you need not ſuch an Orator as I, whoſe Virtues will more commend you, than the beſt Pen and Ink can do. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>I</hi> will eaſe my ſelf a little of the burthen under which <hi>I</hi> lye
<pb facs="tcp:134641:4"/>and make ſome publick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of my Obligations to you, wiſhing this Practical Treatiſe may come ſo near your heart, as that it may do you everlaſting good; and that God would continue to bleſs your Family, as he hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done, that your Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may not degenerate from the exemplary practices of their Anceſtors.

               <salute>To the Practical Reader, for whom this Treatiſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIs a knowing Age in which we live, or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends very much to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or it could not be ſo wicked: yea, the Atheiſt himſelf (that's drown'd in the depth of Ignorance) and is ſo blind a Fool, that he ſaith there is no God, when his own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Tongue wherewith he ſpeaks will give him the Lye; yet will pretend to Knowledge, and think he hath a greater ſhare than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe he can talk at a more deſperate rate, and is priviledg'd by his wickedneſs to laugh at that, at which a ſober man would tremble.
<pb facs="tcp:134641:5"/>One would wonder to think how Knowledge (at leaſt ſuch as is real, and not pretended only) ſhould be ſo miſchievous, and produce ſuch woful effects as it hath done, abroad in the world, when it is in part the Excellency of Man; and the Wiſe Man tells us, without it the Soul cannot be good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. And God complains by the Prophet, that his People are deſtroyed for want of knowledge, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. But the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> is eaſie; It is either an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or crude and indigeſted know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that brings forth ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Births. The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> tells us, that a ſuperficial knowledge of Nature makes an Atheiſt, but a deep ſearch into things produceth a ſound aſſent to the Being and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a ſlight and overly Knowledge of God, and other
<pb facs="tcp:134641:5"/>things related to him, that is the Diſeaſe of this Age, and hath brought forth ſuch pernicious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and the proper cure of this Diſtemper would be frequent, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, impartial Conſideration; than which nothing tends more to ripen and concoct our Knowledge, and to diffuſe its happy Influence to the Heart and Life: I have therefore choſen this Subject, that I might ſhew how eaſie it is for Knowing Men to ſink into Forgetfulneſs of God, and ſo run looſe to all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the ſame degree, that they forget God: And that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevent this miſchief, nor reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of it, but by frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and impartial Meditation. Never any man was wiſe that was not Conſiderate, (whatever frisking Wit he might have) much leſs was ever any man ſoundly Religious,
<pb facs="tcp:134641:6"/>and underſtood the Worth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Religion, and how much it doth befriend his trueſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this world, that did not get out of the noiſe of worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and buſineſs, and think of God, his Word and Works, his Son and Spirit, and his own Immortal Soul, and greateſt Concerns, with true and frequent ſeriouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Fickleneſs, and volability of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed thoughts, is the ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of Humane Nature, ſince it is become degenerate; and a carnal mind, which every one is born with into the world, takes it for its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſure, to turn about like a Weather-Cock to all variety of thoughts, and can endure to ſtay upon nothing, nor be confin'd, though to the beſt Objects. It's the greateſt part of the miſery of a Man yet eſtranged from God, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:134641:6"/>endure to be ſtak'd to any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, though for a ſmall portion of time; whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes impoſſible for him (in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of Providence) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his right mind: You muſt think, and think again, of the ſad and woful conſequences of a Fleſh-pleaſing life, before ever you will eſcape the tempting Baits of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and worldly pleaſures.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of Man is ſo much captivated to his Senſes, whilſt he is in the preſent condition, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer in the world, that till ſerious thoughts recover him, he is like to die and periſh in this miſerable Bondage. Frequent Meditation, and fervent Prayer, would retrieve his Liberty, and ſave him from the Precipice of Vice and Sin, on which an inconſiderate Man will adventure to ſtand without fear, till he feel
<pb facs="tcp:134641:7"/>himſelf tumbling down, and little or no power to ſtop, till he comes to the bottom of it. Men will make a ſhift to decline the moſt cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Truths, and ſuch as have the ſharpeſt point, and find out an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the omiſſion of the plaineſt Duties, by ſome witty Repartees they can return to theſe matters, till ſerious, deep, and impartial Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of them charge them home, and make them prick to the Heart. Till then, what wonder if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Man go with the Oxe to the Slaughter, and with the Fool to the Correction of the Stocks? Till this Dart of Meditation ſtrike thorough his Liver, he will haſten as a Bird to the Snare, not knowing that it is for life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Reader, if thou wouldſt not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the Favour of God, nor loſe Eternal Happineſs, and ruine thine
<pb facs="tcp:134641:7"/>Immortal Soul, nor run deſperately upon Everlaſting Miſery, think on theſe things often and impartially, bind them continually upon thy Heart, and tye them about thy Neck, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.21. otherwiſe thou wilt mourn at the laſt, when Soul and Body (which thou didſt ſo much pamper) are loſt, and ſay, <hi>How have I hated Inſtruction, and my heart</hi> (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough inconſideracy) <hi>deſpiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; nor obeyed the voice of mine own Reaſon, nor inclined mine Ear, when from the Word and Works of God ſhe would have inſtructed me,</hi> Pro. 5.12, 13. There is a Spiritual as well as an Earthly Husbandry, which is the ground of all holy thriving and fruitfulneſs; and Conſideration (if any thing) would Till the Heart, and Manure the Affections, and root Grace in the inward, and make it put forth and flouriſh in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; and God would ſecond
<pb facs="tcp:134641:8"/>it with his Heavenly Showres, and bleſs the ſpringing thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.10. And (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>He that Tilleth his Land ſhall be ſatisfied with bread,</hi> Prov. 12.11. ſo much more he that Tilleth his Heart by daily Meditation, and exerciſe of Grace, ſhall find encreaſe: And I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay in Alluſion to that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.23. Much ſpiritual encreaſe is in the Tillage of the Heart, but there is that which is deſtroyed for want of Conſideration and Judgment. I ſhall detain the Reader no longer from the Treatiſe it ſelf, if he hath any time to ſpare for ſuch a Subject; but only recommend him, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters here mentioned, to the bleſſing of God, that they may ſucceed to his greater Glory, and their Eternal Felicity that may read it; which is the unfeigned Prayer of him that is,</p>

                  </gap>: which may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie either to <hi>Aſaph,</hi> or for <hi>Aſaph:</hi> It is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>David</hi> compoſed the Pſalm and directed it to <hi>Aſaph</hi> or his ſucceſſours, that had the charge of the Muſick of the Temple, to compoſe and prick it to ſome Tune: But however the Scope and Drift of the Pſalm is to reprove the <hi>Jews</hi> who had transformed the Worſhip of God into meer
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:134641:9"/>Pomp and Ceremony, and were come up to that degree of Blindneſs and Abſurdity, that they thought their Sacrifices and Oblations, and the conſtant performances of all that was viſible to the Eye, was highly accepted of God, though their hearts were full of the filth of Luſt and Concupiſcence, and all manner of odious Impiety; hence one of their great Rabbins ſticks not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound (that in the 66. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. v. <hi>If I regaerd ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, God will not hear my prayers</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogatively: <hi>viz.</hi> Though I regard iniquity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not God hear my Prayers? Yes ſurely he will: Hence they are charged by the Prophet, for this very Crime, and God proteſts againſt ſuch ſervice with great Indignation: as if he had never inſtituted and appointed it: <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> Iſa. 1.12. And he upbraids them with their outward oblations, as if they had bin meerly their own Invention, and wholy beſide his order: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if he ſlew a man, he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs neck:</hi> and yet its notorious enough that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded theſe Sacrifices: why then doth he not approve the Execution of his own commands? The truth is, God appointed theſe External Rites, and viſible Symbols of his worſhip: But it was in Conjunction with the inward and more principal worſhip; and whilſt they came in Company with that they were accepted; But when they began to Divorce what God had tyed together by ſuch a flat neceſſity: And when they made no Conſcience of the Moral and Spiritual part of Gods worſhip, but all their care was for the Ceremonial part; It was high time for God to ſhew how he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſted,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:134641:9"/>with ſuch a bodily ſervice as this, that had neither life nor ſpirit, and therefore nothing that ſuited with his Nature, who is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, as well as in form and ſhew: And therefore the Pſalmiſt the better to awake them, ſummons them before the Tribunal of God, as ready to proceed to a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence againſt them. This manner of ſpeech by Parables, Types and Repreſentations of things that were not, (but ſuppoſed to be) were ſchemes of Rhetorick familiar to that People for the more powerful working on the Affections. But here God by a Prolepſis being about to judge, is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with circumſtances of Majeſty and Terror, v. 3. <hi>Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence, a Fire ſhall devour before him, and ſhall be very Tempeſtuous round about him:</hi> with ſome alluſion to the dreadful appearance of God at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when he gave the Law, &amp; now comes to require an account of it, with as terrible an appearance, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>He ſhall call to the Heavens above,</hi> (that is the Angels) to cite and gather theſe guilty Sinners before Him, that were like to ſpeed ſo much the worſe, becauſe they were in league with God, Sanctified by an external Covenant made with him, but yet trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly and perfidiouſly broken: therefore call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints; <hi>Gather my Saints together thoſe that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice,</hi> v. 5. Then comes in the charge, ver. 7. <hi>Hear O my people,</hi> which is amplyfied to the end of the Pſalm: and the folly and unbecomingneſs of ſuch a worſhip, detected and ſet forth to the life, which that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid people preſented him with inſtead of Service worthy ſo glorious a Majeſty: Do you think that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:134641:10"/>Bullocks, and He Goats are things that I Regard: If I had ſuch a delight in theſe as you take me to have, <hi>I have no need to come to you; for every Beaſt of the Foreſt is mine, and the Cattle upon a thouſand Hills, I know all the Fowles of the Mountains,</hi> v. 10, 11. <hi>If I were hungry I would not tell thee.</hi> See what groſs conceits they had of God as if he had an appetite after the fleſh of Bulls and the blood of Goats <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. whether they were ſo ſottiſh as to think that God did feed upon ſuch Diet as this, and did take pleaſure in it, by a plain and direct apprehenſion; it matters not much; be ſure, they were guilty of ſuch a Sin by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and interpretation, whilſt they could go on with ſo much confidence in the oblation of ſuch Sacrifices, when their hearts were perfectly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any Love and Reverence of God, and their hands were full of Rapine and Blood, and uſed no attention of Mind to conſider what theſe outward Sacrifices did ſignifie to them: And then in the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> he ſhews them the true and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable worſhip, after he had confuted their blaſphemous apprehenſions; which conſiſts of two principal parts in which all the reſt is included. Firſt, Hearty Thankſgiving, for what they have and do receive. Secondly, And fervent prayer for what they want, by which a better Teſtimony is given to God, than by their richeſt oblations. And this the very Heathen could diſcern by their Candle, <hi>Immunis aram,</hi> ſaith <hi>Horace, &amp;c.</hi> They confeſſed that a Soul breathing forth its ſelf in holy Hymns is more acceptable to God, than the richeſt Gums or ſweeteſt Wood that can ſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar: But theſe Jews were ſo Intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:134641:10"/>that they thought they did a high favour to God, whilſt they took his name into their mouths, and declared his Statutes, though they perfectly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be reform'd; though they conſented to theſe, and were guilty of Adultery, and gave their Mouth to ill, and their Tongue to frame deceit: yea they made nothing of caſting Slanders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches upon their deareſt Friends, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. Yea, and to compleat their wickedneſs to the full, they interpreted the patience of God towards them all this while as an approbation of their abominable Wickedneſs, <hi>ver. before the Text. Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence,</hi> that is, I patiently forbore thee a long time, and thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf. Then follows the Sentence; <hi>But I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes;</hi> and make thee feel what it is to mock God, and be guilty of ſuch Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>The words are the Application of this that hath been taught in the former part of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> That ſince God will upon no terms be reconciled to Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, nor hold his peace always at thoſe practices which his Soul hateth, though the perſons being guilty, ſet them off with the Paint and Varniſh of the moſt ſpecious outward Obſervances, and make a moſt boaſting mention of his Name, and cry, <hi>the Temple of the Lord.</hi> Since this is Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Reſolution, be wiſe, <hi>Now conſider this ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where you have:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Uſe that they and we are to make of the righteous and impartial Sentence that God

               <p n="2">2. The perſons that are to make this uſe of it, or to whom the Exhortation is directed, that is ſuch as forget God, YE THAT FORGET GOD.</p>

               <p n="2">2. From the unavoidableneſs of Gods Wrath, and the impoſſibility of Eſcape; AND THERE BE NONE TO DELIVER, or ſnatch out of my hands.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Conſideration</hi> is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal means on our part to bring us to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of God at the firſt, and to prevent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:134641:11"/>of that degree of forgetfulneſs into which we may poſſibly fall.</p>
               <p>The method that I ſhall take to infuſe the <hi>firſt Doctrine,</hi> and to get it into our hearts and Lives, ſhall be; 1. To begin with the Underſtanding, by which Door every Truth muſt enter, that can make any ſolid operation upon the other Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to prepare them for practice; and to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is to forget God in the General.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More particularly, who they are that are guilty of this ſin.</p>
               <p>And 3. I ſhall ſhew you the heinouſneſs and danger of this ſin, in the Inferences; and then on</p>
               <p n="4">4. To a cloſer Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to forget God in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>To forget God, is</p>
               <p>Not to have that impreſs of his Exiſtence, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Relations to us, upon our ſeveral Faculties; nor thoſe frequent, reverential, and affectionate thoughts of him, that do enable us to a Sovereign Love and Obedience to him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In which Deſcription, Note; Firſt, That forgetfulneſs is not the act of the Memory only in this place, but there is ſome of this poiſon in all the Faculties: for the Rule is ſolid, and worth the obſervation; That no Act is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat that is not the act of the whole Man: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Will, and Executive Power; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are united in one Frame; and there is no action, that's virtuous and vicious (for that I mean by moral) to which every one of theſe Wheels of the Soul do not contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:134641:12"/>and therefore if the hand of a Clock or Watch move regularly, every one of the inward Wheels is moved rightly, and is free from fault o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> blame; but if the hand go falſe, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the Fabrick move amiſs, though perchance the fault <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ye principally in one pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar part, but yet the errour is propagated to the whole. So if any action of man be faulty, the whole man is culpable, and the fault is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther originally, or by derivation in every pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faculty of the Man; ſo Love to God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. 1. A Knowledg worthy of him in the Underſtanding, Complacency in the Will; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Conformity to, and union with him in the powers that are to execute, or elſe the act of Love is not rational and compleat. To have ſome motion in the will or affections, that is not cauſed by a foregoing notice or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that is weighty of him, is a Fanatical Love; a flaſh that will be as ſoon out as in, and never ſet his hand and his feet a work in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: ſo we are ſaid to <hi>know God,</hi> when we have not only a notion of him in the underſtanding, but ſuitable motion in the will and affections: <hi>This is Life Eternal to know Thee,</hi> John 17.3. This is the manner of Scripture, yea and common diſcourſe when we ſpeak of moral Acts (that is) ſuch as perſons endued with underſtanding and free will, do perform.</p>
               <p>And though the denomination or name be taken ſometime from one faculty, ſometime from another, yet the reſt are uſually implyed, or ſuppoſed ſubſervient actions are in common ſpeech, ſilently implyed in the principal: and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:134641:12"/>hence that Rule that Divines ſo frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate; That words of knowledg and ſenſe, imply affections and actions; <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the Righteous,</hi> that is, ſo as to approve and juſtifie it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt. Thou didſt not lay theſe things to heart; neither didſt thou remember thy latter end,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> to <hi>Babylon, Iſa.</hi> 47.7. that is, thou didſt not take it into thy thoughts ſo as to work upon thy heart, and to get thy ſelf in a readineſs for that houre. For where there is, or ſhould be a Connexion Train, or Series of Actions, to name one, is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all the reſt; but moſt uſually, where we are provoked to any duty that will require ſeveral diſtinct acts; the whole duty is named from the leading Act, as here in the Text, <hi>Conſider this, &amp;c.</hi> An Object muſt firſt be taken into the thoughts, and then be judged weighty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, before it can have any influence up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n the affections and life: and ſo in the following words, <hi>ye that forget God.</hi> As not remembring God is the firſt Act to neglect of Duty and Diſobedience: but yet ſometime the very ultimate and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Act is named, and all the reſt implyed and preſuppoſed, as in all thoſe Scriptures, where, ſalvation is promiſed to obedience: there all the fore-going acts are underſtood, without which it would not be true obedience. Since therefore the end of this conſideration, and thoughtfulneſs to which wicked men, and ſuch as forget God are exhorted, is that they may clearly diſcern his excellency above all things; and by this diſcovery kindle the higheſt love to him in the heart; and by that prepare for the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:134641:13"/>readieſt obedience. Therefore <hi>I</hi> define forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to be, the want of ſuch knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods eſſence and perfections, as is neceſſary to produce the higheſt Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note Secondly, That every degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring God, and thinking on him, yea though it be with ſome degrees of Love and Pleaſure, Praiſe and Thankfulne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, will not acquit a man from the Dreadful Sin of Forgetfulneſs; If the thoughts be not ſo frequent, ſo magnificent, as to produce a love ſuitable to his Nature, <hi>(that is)</hi> Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all other Love, whereby the ſoul is then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the higheſt obebience: otherwiſe he that is defective in this high and ſovereign degree is ſtill condemned among thoſe that are here ſaid to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God. So much in Anſwer to the firſt queſtion; What it is to forget God in general? and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to the anſwer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, who they are more particularly, that forget God?</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, though I might reckon up as many as their are diſtinct and particular Sins that prevail in diſtinct and particular men: As the Proud, the Envious, the Adulterous, the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous: And ſo multiply particulars to a vaſt number. For every one of theſe may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to forget God; Yet <hi>I</hi> will confine my ſelf to theſe three ſorts;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe that remember not the great attributes of God, and the Relations wherein they ſtand to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that think not on his ſacred and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable word.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:134641:13"/>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that overlook his moſt obſervable works.</p>
               <p>Its ſome great defect in one or all theſe that doth both breed and feed all other Forgetfulneſs of God, ſpecified in any prevailing ſins whatſover, becauſe the forgetting of any theſe three grand points of remembrance, betrays to all impiety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, all unrighteouſneſs towards men, and all ill uſage and government of a mans ſelf, which <hi>three Capital Sins,</hi> imply all mortal wickedneſs whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> ſhall begin with the firſt;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe may be ſaid notoriouſly to forget God, that remember not the great Attributes that are ſo eſſential to him; we are not able to ſee his naked eſſence: 'Tis therefore by his Attributes that we come to know him, at leaſt in this Life. And he that wants a competent underſtanding of theſe, and that in ſuch a meaſure as to Empower his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will to acts, that become ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perfections, lies open unto every ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to be drawn away and enticed to any prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, though never ſo wicked, whereby he may come to enjoy, what he doth thus Idolize, for want of a better object.</p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> will more particularly inſiſt upon two or three of thoſe Relations, which every wicked man either (1.) wants a right knowledge of, or (2.) doth not conſider; and every one that doth not conſider muſt needs be a wicked man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, they conſider not that God is their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, &amp; gave them that Being and Perfections which they ſo ungratefully abuſe to his diſhonour: They think not what an obligation this is to the higheſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:134641:14"/>Love, Gratitude, and Obedience; What a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blindneſs is this to live and go about the world, and to uſe the very Soul and Body that God hath given thee and yet, to look no higher than thy Father that begot thee, and thy Mother that brought thee forth: <hi>Woe unto him that ſaith to a Srock, thou art my Father, and to a Stone thou haſt brought me forth,</hi> Jer. 2.27. Canſt thou think that thoſe eyes were made to look no higher, or doſt think that thou art ſolely or princiaplly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted unto them for that Being, and Wiſdom that advanceth thee ſo far above other Creatures? Such a thought, yea the want of a quite contrary thought, will debaſe thee as much below, as now thou art exalted above other Creatures. But yet be it never ſo abſurd: This is the woful caſe and condition of the far greateſt part of men. One would think that if the Remembrance of ſo plain and Confeſſed a Truth as this is, would acquit a man of this horrid Sin of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God, that none would be Guilty. But alas! there are few that would eſcape, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I ſay again few woult eſcape. They are not many in compariſon that think ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſo ſeaſonably of this truth, as to get a full ſight of it into the underſtanding till it fall down before it, and after it hath recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſelf out of extaſy and amazement, doth uſe its authority to the utmoſt to awaken the other powers to perceive it, that ſo nothing might hinder the love and ſervice that ſuch a Mercy calls for, nor be able to wipe off ſo high an obligation: if men were not ſo prone to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that they are Creatures, and ſtand in ſo near
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:134641:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>relation unto God that gave them their breath and being, and doth ſupport them every hour: why is this knowledg ſo often inculcated in the word of God? for this the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and his Wives and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, <hi>that they praiſed the Gods of Silver and Gold, and Braſs which ſee not, nor hear, nor know, and the God in whoſe hand thy breath is, and whoſe are all thy ways, haſt thou not glorified,</hi> Dan. 5.23.</p>
               <p>But what do I ſpeak of a ſingle perſon, and ſome few others with him: you may ſee whole Nations ſadly charged with it in Scripture. <hi>The Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib; but Iſrael doth not my people doth not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Iſa. 1.3, 4. and if Gods own people were thus ſhamefully guilty, what judgment may be paſſed upon other Nations; if this great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation every Soul ſtands in to God were well thought upon; and all things that have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to inchant the mind, and controll the mighty power of this truth upon the ſoul, were in a good meaſure diſgraced and turned out of the heart: It could not be that heart and mouth, and life ſhould be ſo intollerably backward to any ſerious ſervice of God, as they are in the moſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They forget God that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look his Sovereignty, and forget that he is the holy, juſt, and righteous Governour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. 1. That he is the abſolute and univerſal Sovereign that hath the moſt unqueſtionable authority to command and govern the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he hath made. 2. The greateſt wiſdom to contrive the moſt perfect Laws for the good
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:134641:15"/>of all his Subjects. 3. And the moſt irreſiſtible power to ſee them executed. 4. And the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt juſtice to ſee, that neither Law, nor Subject ſhall receive any detriment or damage. And if this were believed and conſidered, would men either deſire, or dare to caſt off ſuch a Yoke, and tranſgreſs ſuch a Law, and provoke ſuch impartial juſtice? What a monſtrous pride muſt it needs be, that makes a man unwilling to ſubmit to ſuch a Government? And what a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, befooled, lying heart muſt that be, that can promiſe it ſelf indemnity, and think to ſpeed well in a ſtate of diſobedience? Let the deceived heart that hath turned thee aſide from ſuch an honourable, gainful ſervice, tell thee whom thou canſt ſerve to better purpoſe, and under whoſe command thine own welfare would be better promoted. I know thou wouldſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the thought of being his ſervant, who is the firſt-born of all pride, inſolence, and cruelty; and yet there is no poſſible way of eſcape, if the Yoke of thy rightful Sovereign be too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for thee. May be thou mayſt be ſo void of underſtanding, as to think if thou hadſt none to controll thine actions, but wert thine own Lord, and accountable to none other but thy ſelf; and that thou mightſt let out thy heart with a full Rein to all that it deſireth; it were a condition to be deſired above any other; but haſt thou wit enough to manage all thy affairs; ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to protect thy ſelf; ſoreſight enough to keep out of a thouſand evils, that thy own blindneſs and nakedneſs would expoſe thee to! Thy Luſts and thy Paſſions would make worſe

               <p>But it may be thou meaneſt, that this State were the moſt deſirable, if thou hadſt wiſdom enough to direct thee, and power enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thy ſelf; and fulneſs enough to ſupply all thine own wants: and art thou not now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſuch a prodigious pride, as would ſit down in the Throne of God, and aſpire to the divine perfections?</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt whither this inclination leadeth, and what a ſymtom of deſtruction it muſt needs be; and yet be thy caſe never ſo bad and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they that will habitually overlook that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right and ſovereignty, and their neceſſſity of ſubjection, and both from the wiſdom and juſtice of the Laws, and power of the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and that there is no wiſdom nor happineſs like theirs that chearfully obey, muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelves in theſe woful conſequences, fall into the abſurdeſt ſins, that will but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and gratifie this proud inclination.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They forget God, that are not prevailingly under the power of this thought; that God is their happineſs: and that if all the world were theirs, and God ſhould deny the light and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical preſence of himſelf they could never find reſt or ſatisfaction: <hi>Let the honour and Majeſty of a King, and the Glory of a Kingdom be given unto</hi> David; <hi>and let him have all the aſſiſtance that ſuch a power can afford; to compaſs the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:134641:16"/>that the heart of man can wiſh for,</hi> yet this will not do. In the midſt of this fulneſs and ſufficiency he is in ſtreights, <hi>Job</hi> 20.22. If God withdraw; When thou hideſt thy face I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. And when this was wanting, his moiſture was turned into the draught of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and his bones were broken; hence he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God to reſtore the joy of his ſalvation, and uphold him with his free ſpirit; and to make him to hear of joy and gladneſs, that the bones that he had broken might rejoyce, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8, 12. Who that hath any experience in the world, can be fool enough to believe, that his ſoul will be quieted with ſuch a Weathercock and Rattle as the world is; and popt off with noiſe inſtead of ſubſtance; and liſten with full contentment to the Sounding Braſs and Tinkling Cymbal? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! The Bias of a Mans Soul is after ſomething that the world hath not, ſomething like it ſelf; and cannot be truly ſatisfied with theſe things, becauſe they have no proportion with it ſelf; They are fleſh, and that is ſpirit; nor thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted with theſe ſhews, becauſe the time is at hand, when it ſhall be truly ſaid, as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid of her Children, they are not. Give the Child that cryes for the Breaſt what you will, and it gives not over, becauſe this is the only thing it wants. The Soul will never be ſtill, nor give over its muttering and complaints, till it hath the very thing that fully ſupplies its want; and that only is God: and they that live not under the power of this perſwaſion, will run after every ſhadow, and be ticed into mortal ſin; and yet at laſt loſe their labour and hope; and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:134641:16"/>all this becauſe they forget that God is their Reſt, and that their Happineſs is bound up in him. Jog thy ſelf a little, and conſider what it is to be God, but to have All-ſufficiency? and to have all Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, Raviſhing Excellency, in the greateſt Tranſcendency, without any Bounds or Ends? what it is to be God but to have all imaginable Perfection? And therefore to think we remember God, when we forget thoſe Perfections which are his very Being, is a lie with a witneſs, and will prove one with a vengeance, if thou doſt not pray to God, and prevail with him to have thy Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſtored, and to heal this defect thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They forget God that live not under a daily ſenſe of his Omniſcience, and forget that his Eye pierceth the thickeſt darkneſs, and that nothing is hid from his diſtinct Obſervation: For he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth this, denieth God, and he that forgetteth this, forgets that, without which God cannot be God. Tell me, thou that abhoreſt Atheiſm with thy Tongue; why art thou ſo notoriouſly guilty of it in thy practice? Why doſt thou with-draw from the Eyes of Men, when thou haſt ſome filthineſs to commit which thou art aſhamed they ſhould ſee or know? Why doſt thou ſhut thy ſelf up in thy Cloſet, that there thou mayeſt hide thy Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Folly, and dareſt not publiſh thy Levity, Shame, or Wickedneſs, unto holy and diſcerning Men? Nay, it may be not to Men as wicked as thy ſelf? Such a reproach is folly, vanity, and wickedneſs unto any man. Yea, Why doſt thou retire into thy own heart (as if thou wouldſt lock all up, and make all ſure) and there exerciſe thy ſelf in Pride, Envy, Self-conceit, Uncleanneſs;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:134641:17"/>and act theſe ſins with confidence and ſecurity, in the darkneſs of thy heart, which if another like thy ſelf did but ſee, thou wouldſt not know where to hide thy ſelf for ſhame? And yet becauſe all hath been tranſacted with ſo much ſilence and ſecrecy, thou haſt no diſpoſition to bluſh or be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed; but like the Whore in the <hi>Prov. Thou eateſt and wipeſt thy mouth, and ſay'ſt, What ſhame have I done?</hi> And doſt thou think there is no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy ſhameful wicked acts? No Eye to take notice? Better all the World had ſeen thee than he that ſtands but for a cypher to thy deluded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful Heart. I might here run over all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, both Eſſential, Subſiſtential, and Relative, and oppreſs your Memory with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: But having given theſe inſtances, I leave the reſt to your Meditations. Yet before I leave this head and proceed to the ſecond, I ſhall add thus much of the Attributes of God in general.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They may be ſaid to forget them all at once, that forget themſelves, and live not under a ſenſe of their <hi>great neceſſities,</hi> nor think conſiderately, and perſwade themſelves day by day, that they are poor and miſerable, and blind and naked; <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. They that are rich in their own apprehenſions, and increaſed in Goods and have need of nothing, muſt needs be ſtout and inſolent, and cannot eſcape this ſin of Forgetfulneſs. <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,</hi> that is <hi>Iſrael,</hi> waxed fat and kicked againſt God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. and they never remembred him to the purpoſe, till they themſelves by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, or God by his Judgments, did inforce a ſenſe of their neceſſities on them. When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:134641:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>and inquired early after God. And they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer, which before they forgot, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78.34, 35. And yet ſo ſoon as ever they were out of ſtreights and warm in Proſperity, and thought they had no need, they forgot God again. They remembred not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the Enemy, <hi>ver.</hi> 42.</p>
               <p>That man muſt needs ſend up cold and careleſs Prayers to God day by day, that feels none, or but little need of God. How can be confeſs with a broken heart, the ſins that never come near his heart, nor were a burthen to him? How can that man magnifie or ſeek the Grace of God every day, that doth not verily think he needs it every day? How can he worthily admire his Redeemer, who hath loved him, and waſhed his Soul in his Blood, that feels not his own Guilt, and doth not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently renew loathing and abhorring thoughts of it? How can he lift up his Heart to the Father of Lights, for the Spirit of Illumination, that doth not ſufficiently apprehend and bewail his own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and the darkneſs of his uncertain mind? How can he rejoyce in the hopes of the Glory of God, that fooliſhly adores, and cheat himſelf with the Glory of this World? The day of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and full Redemption will never be a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Meditation unto him, that feels not himſelf oppreſſed with his ſins, and is as heartily weary of that Burthen, as he is of Sickneſs, when it afflicts his Body. Never think to meditate on Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, with any Savour or Delight, unleſs you bend your thoughts to conſider the miſchiefs of Injuſtice; and how particular Families and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:134641:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Nations, yea, and the whole World, are perverted and diſturbed with Iniquity. Thou wilt never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy Heart to God for Wiſdom to live well, unleſs thou remember thy latter end; and what haſt the comforts of this World make to get away from thee. Can he live above in his thoughts with any content and ſatisfaction, that doth not die daily, and not often think with ſome ſeriouſneſs that he may daily die. It's wiſdom therefore to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to ſuch thoughts. How many have ſhut their Eyes in a healthful Sleep, who have waked in another World? We give too large ſcope to our account, while we reckon ſeven years for a Life, when we ſee ſo many diſpatch'd within the Circle and Revolution of half that time; and though we are ſuch a blaſt our ſelves, yet our comforts are oftentimes dead and buried before us, and leave us the ſurviving Executors of our own miſery. When God hath put all things here below into the <hi>Bill of Mortality,</hi> what a fooliſh thought is it to think that this or that ſhall eſcape, which we have ſet our hearts upon? and how ſinful to take the Bill and write down this or that, or the other, when God hath condemned no leſs than all? If thou forget theſe things, God would be forgotten; and one or two ſlight thoughts of theſe things will never excuſe from forgetfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the firſt ſort of Men that forget God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They forget God, that either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or think but little on his <hi>ſacred and moſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Word,</hi> when they have it continually before them. I will not go about now to deſcribe the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:134641:18"/>woful ſtate and condition of that Man, that hath the Word ſo much in his Eyes, yea, in his Ears, and not in his Heart, (and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember it in any ſaving degree or meaſure) nor torment ſuch a one before his time; neither can I tell him the nature and danger of his Sin ſo well as Death or Judgment will be ſure to tell him. It muſt needs be a ſtaring, affrighting Sin, when Conſcience ſhall come to ſee it throughly, that God hath written to us the Great things of his Law, and we have counted them as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing; <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8.12. It's in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>(i.) Amplitudines,</hi> or <hi>Honorabilia legis,</hi> and they counted them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as a ſtrange thing <hi>(i.)</hi> They made themſelves ſtrange to them; or theſe things were ſtrange to them and ſeldom in their Thoughts. This is a wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of ſuch a ſtrange and wonderful Love. More particularly,</p>
               <p>They forget the Word of God,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That have not a high and tranſcendent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the Authority thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They that are not in any conſiderable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure affected with the important matters, which it ſets before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That are not awakened by any ſerious thoughts of the moſt <hi>certain and near accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of all that is either threatned or promiſed therein.</p>
               <p>I ſay again,</p>
               <p>They that are not awed by its Authority, nor moved with its Importance, nor rouzed by its
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:134641:19"/>certainty, (1.) To yield hearty Subjection unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (2.) To his Laws, (3.) And by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Reſolution to renounce either ſelf, or whatſoever doth oppoſe them, will never eſcape this guilt, but be numbred amongſt the <hi>Forgetters of Gods Word.</hi> For Faith or Subjection to the Perſon of Chriſt, and Obedience to his Laws, and abrenunciation of all that would hinder this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of our Hearts and Obedience of our Lives, are <hi>Three great ends</hi> for which the Word of God was ordained and appointed, and a high Reverence of its Authority, and deep Senſe of its Importance, and firm perſwaſion of its certainty would moſt undoubtedly bring to paſs: For it is moſt unqueſtionable, that God would not fail theſe his own means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They muſt read or hear theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſlightly and unworthily, that are not deeply wrought upon, by the conſideration of <hi>their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> and the Divinity that is inſtamp'd upon them. It's not enough that you believe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this, but that you be frequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thought of it. And it is a weighty truth, worthy your remembrance, That the Soul is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought upon to any purpoſe, either in its Underſtanding, Will or Affections, but <hi>by frequent, ſerious, and repeated Acts.</hi> The main difficulty therefore in the work of Converſion, and a ſaving change, on our part, lies here, in bringing our thoughts to a devout and frequent meditation of theſe Objects, which God hath reſolved ſhall do the work if ever it be done. And though he can change the Heart by a word and in a moment, if he pleaſe, yet he hath told us flatly he will not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:134641:19"/>do it ordinarily, without theſe means. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he awakens every Soul to ſuch Meditations, whom he will ſhew mercy to. A Mans Thoughts are the means that God makes moſt uſe of in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his Heart. Do thou not preſume, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, that God will infuſe <hi>Sanctification</hi> into thy <hi>Heart</hi> by a miracle, when thou art thinking all the day, yea, all the week long, upon meer vanity, if not doing worſe. <hi>But this by the way.</hi> He that doth not ſtrike his heart into ſuperlative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of this Word, by thinking often of that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by whom it was word for word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, will never be made fit to take it into his heart, and chew upon it when he lies down and riſeth up; to curb every baſe Inclination of his Soul by it, and to reſolve they ſhall bend to this Word or have no quiet. The Heart is ſo prone to Earth and Vanity, and the Fleſh with its Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Luſts, are ſo ſtrong and maſterleſs, that they will never obey unleſs ſuch Authority be produced. Yea, there's none that are well vers'd in their own Hearts, but will find how they will ſlight ſuch Authority, and ſometime venture to contemn it. But as he that doth wiſely govern a Family, or other Society, much more a Kingdom, will not ſuffer his Authority to be trampled on, nor his Laws to ſtand for Ciphers, but will vindicate them with the greateſt Power and Majeſty that he can put on; much more will the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſtand up in the behalf of his own Authority, and vindicate the beſt Laws that ever were made from contempt. And if any ſinner be ſo ſottiſh as to think, that his Wit, or Pedigree, or Riches, or Eſteem in the World, will bear him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:134641:20"/>out in ſuch irreverence, let me ſay to ſuch a one as once <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.16. Stay and I will tell thee what the Lord hath ſaid of ſuch a one. <hi>Them that honour me I will honour, and they that deſpiſe me ſhall lightly be eſteemed;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. Be as wiſe and as great as thou wilt, the Lord will ſhame thee ſooner or later, and kick thee down into Scorn and Diſgrace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are forgetful of the Word of God, that are not conſiderably moved with the moſt important matters which it ſets before them. If thou readeſt it not frequently, thou forgeteſt it in the groſſeſt ſenſe, and thine own Conſcience will fall upon and condemn thee. And if thou doſt read it, yet if thy very Heart be not affected with thoſe matters in the Word, which more concern thee than all the World, ſo as to ſhew it in thy Life, I would not for all the World hear that Judgment that thou ſhalt ſhortly hear. Doth it ſo much concern thee what thou ſhalt Eat, and what thou ſhalt Drink, and wherewithal thou ſhalt be cloathed, and how thou ſhalt Sleep, or enjoy thy Health, much more how thou ſhalt viſit this or that Friend, do this or that petty buſineſs, as how thou ſhalt ſave thy Soul? how thou mayſt get thy Heart affected with its Sin and Miſery, and ſet a value upon Chriſt as he deſerveth? (this is not eaſily done;) how thou mayſt break off thine Affections from theſe things that will abuſe them, and certainly blaſt every good work in thy Heart, and turn thy Religion into meer Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? For it is impoſſible that the Love of God ſhould be in that Heart, where the love of any worldly thing doth prevail. Hearken therefore and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:134641:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>liſten attentively, what neceſſity the Word of God layeth upon Self-denial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mortification of the Fleſh, with its Affections and Luſts. <hi>He that will be my Diſciple muſt deny himſelf, take up his Croſs and follow me; Luke</hi> 9.23. <hi>And if ye live after the Fleſh ye ſhall die; Rom.</hi> 8.13. If thine Eſtate, Life, or Credit, only were here concerned, thy neglect would not prove thee ſo perfectly mad and diſtracted as now it doth, when the Eternal Life and Welfare of thy Soul is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They that live not under any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of the certain accompliſhment of all that is threatned, or promiſed in the Word, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but forget the Word. The things that are contained in the Scripture, if they were liable to ſome doubt, yet were worthy to be thought on, becauſe they concern ſo much, if they ſhould prove true. And this is an Argument that will ſtop their Mouths, that chuſe a Romance or vain Ballad, before the Word of God, to be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their thoughts. But when God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make good every Judgment he hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the impenitent ſinner; and when every wicked perſon that dies in his ſin, ſhall as certainly feel thoſe dreadful Woes, as now he hears or may hear them pronounced; O what an advantage is here, to beget a Reſolution to withſtand every Temptation that would draw us to thoſe things that are thus threatned? Though it were a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and profitable Luſt, it's ſtark madneſs to fulfil it. O if we had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or felt the wrath of God in another World, it would be Armour of Proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all wilful preſumptuous ſin, for ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:134641:21"/>and would awaken the Soul to any pains or diligence to eſcape it: And is it not as certain as if we had ſeen or felt it? Hath the Lord ſaid that he will laugh at the deſtruction of a ſinner, and mock when his fear cometh? <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. Hath he ſaid, that he will ſhortly come with his Fan in his hand, and thorowly purge his Floor, and gather his Wheat into the Garner, but that he will burn up the Chaff with unquenchable Fire; and will this not ſurely be brought to paſs? <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. Heaven and Earth may ſooner paſs away, than one jot or tittle of his Word ſhall paſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. Things that will certainly come to paſs, if they concern us in this life only; though they be not near, yet they are not ſlighted by us: But if they are near and certain, and highly concerning, the thoughts thereof will ruſh in upon us, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the greateſt neceſſity of nature; they will diſturb our Reſt, and make us forget to eat our Bread.</p>
               <p>Could a Man that were to be tryed for his Life to morrow, or a day or two hence, eat his Meat quietly, or lie down upon his Bed in peace, and take his Reſt? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8. And canſt thou read the Threats or Promiſes in the Word of God, that concern thee ſo unſpeakably, and may be made good within one day or hour, for all thou knoweſt, and yet be no more overwhelmed with Joy or Terror? They that are not awakened with the ſerious affecting thoughts of the moſt certain and near accompliſhment of all that is threatned or promiſed in the Word of God, will certainly be condemned in the number of thoſe that do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:134641:21"/>
               <p>Theſe are the ſecond ſort of <hi>thoſe that forget God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that think not upon his ſacred, venerable Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They forget God indeed, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook his moſt obſervable Works, and regard not his remarkable Providences. The Works of the Lord are great, both of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure in them; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.2. And thoſe that have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them will be ſure to forget them.</p>
               <p>There be ſeveral ways by which the Works and Providence of God is overlooked, or ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons guilty of this ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are ſignally guilty, that deny Gods Providence in the Rule and Diſpoſe of all Affairs, either directly or by plain conſequence. There are none that deny it in the firſt ſenſe (that is) directly and expreſly, but plain Atheiſts, of which I would there were none in this Nation, that believe in their Hearts that all things come to paſs by <hi>Fate</hi> or <hi>Chance.</hi> But they deny <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> by <hi>Conſequence</hi> and <hi>Interpretation,</hi> that are ſo intent upon Means and Inſtruments, whereby any effect is brought to paſs, or rather upon the Effect it ſelf, that they do not at all look up any higher; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. The Wicked thorow the Pride of his Countenance will not ſeek after God; God is not in all his thoughts; thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are far above out of his ſight.</p>
               <p>Theſe lie under a deep guilt of this ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are guilty of this Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:134641:22"/>alſo, that can find out nothing among all the works of Creation and Providence, ſo worthy their Obſervation, as to captivate their Souls to the <hi>higheſt Reverence</hi> of their Author: Higheſt I mean, not in reſpect of the degrees of Reverence, but of the kinds; that is, though he hath a Reverence for this Object, and another for that, another for a third; yet he hath <hi>Higheſt</hi> and moſt principal veneration for him who doth ſo incomparably manage all things. And who hath impudence enough to plead for that man that hath an underſtanding and conſidering Faculty, and ſuch Wonders to behold both in Heaven and Earth, ſuch Providences towards the World in general, and ſuch towards the Church in ſpecial, and yer God no higher in his Judgment and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in his Thoughts and Heart, than a full Cheſt, and a little painted Skin, and an adored Luſt? What, haſt thou heard the Voice of the Lord ſo often in Thunder and Lightning, and ſeen the dreadful effects of them? Haſt thou not heard of a little of his Breath ſhut up in the caverns of the Earth, that hath made this ſtable Body of the Earth to ſhake and tremble, and rent and torn the very bowels thereof, and overturned whole Cities at once? Haſt thou heard of the Diviſion of <hi>Jordan</hi> and the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> how the Waters parted and left a path-way in the midſt of them, whilſt the People paſſed over, of whom God had taken on him the Care and Conduct? And how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his mighty Hoſt were afterward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed by the ſame Waters, who were their profeſſed Enemies?

When God is telling Men plainly of their Sabbath-breaking; careleſs performance of his Service and Worſhip, Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inordinate love of, and Adulterous Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to any Creature; and hiding Pride from Man, and turning our Eyes from a fond Admiration of Creatures, and laying them in the duſt; They will not endure it, but fret and murmur in their hearts; and are ready to ſay as the Rebellious Followers of <hi>Korah</hi> did to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Wilt thou put out theſe Eyes of ours? We will not come down; we will not deny our ſelves, nor be croſſed in our wills, nor leave our ſhame. When God is putting the Bridle into their Mouths, and laying a

We will not hearken to thee, but will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth of our own Mouth; we will let our Hearts with a full rein to any thing they deſire; for when we have done thus we were well and ſaw no evil; when we leave off to ſhew fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and courteſie to our ſelves, who ſhall befriend us? when we begin to cry ſhame on our ſelves, all men will cry ſhame on us; and if once we come down and lie in the duſt, all men will trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Thoſe are ſome of the ſhifts that carnal Wiſdom and Reaſon alledgeth, whereby it would fruſtrate the Invitations of Mercy. When God is calling for the Plumb Line, and meting out a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Deſtruction, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.7. when he is drawing the lines of confuſion in a place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. and marking it for Judgment, they cry as the Inhabitants of <hi>Ephraim</hi> once did, The Bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewen Stones; the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.10.</p>
               <p>And though we may not be gotten up to ſuch a degree of wickedneſs as this is, it will concern us to make ſearch and inquiry, whether there be no ſeed of this wicked nature in us. I am too much out of doubt, that there is much of croſſneſs and

I mean a ſhew of humility, in going ſoftly, ſpeaking faintly, looking ſadly, inſtead of true lowlineſs and poverty of Spirit; I ſpeak not againſt the outward ſigns, they are good, when accompanied with the thing ſignified; but when we deceive our ſelves with theſe, and think to deceive God alſo.

So that hence it is evident, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> laid down his <hi>Blood</hi> as a price, to redeem them that ungratefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him. And if Chriſt had not died for all, it could not be the duty of every man to believe in him. But there is nothing more unqueſtionable than that every one is bound to believe, and ſuch as refuſe, are threatned with a more fearful deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they wickedly fruſtrate (as much as in them lies) ſuch a wonderful Grace of God, and withſtand the higheſt motive to Repentance and a new life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie him in your Body and in your Spirit, which are his.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaketh to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> in general, among whom there were many unbelievers. And what's the Argument he uſeth to perſwade them to Faith and newneſs of Life; but becauſe Chriſt hath ſhewed ſuch love to them as to die for them; Since he hath offered up his Body upon the Croſs for you, do you offer up your Souls and Bodies unto him, to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Righteouſneſs to do him ſervice, is the force of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Argument.</p>
                     <p>We ſee then, that the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Gift of the Spirit,</hi> are obligations upon all (that hear the Goſpel at leaſt) to a thankful Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the love of God, and a Remembrance of him. There are none that live under the ſound and influence of the Goſpel, but have the love of Chriſt expreſſed in his Incarnation, Life and Death, for them to move them externally, by way of Argument, and the powerful Spirit inwardly to check their Corruptions, and prompt them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in ſome degree and meaſure; and if they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:134641:34"/>will not think upon the one nor ſubmit to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſlightly regard the one, and ſtubbornly reſiſt the other, and ſtiffle every good motion, which they feel, and keep off from any ſerious thoughts of the death of Chriſt, and will not be perſwaded to conſider, the Blood that was ſhed for them, nor ſuffer his love to be ſhed abroad into their hearts by the Holy Spirit. Let ſuch know that their forgetfulneſs of God is the more heynous, becauſe it hath ſo faſt an obligation as this, to the moſt neceſſary duty of remembrance, the <hi>Word</hi> alſo as well as the <hi>Spirit.</hi> What are all the paſſages of Scripture, but ſuch as prepare for, or directly ſtir up to ſuch a Remembrance. You may obſerve ſome parts of Scripture more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely conduce to this grand duty of remembring God; other parts do more immediately ſerve to produce it where it is wanting, others to reduce and recover it when 'tis loſt. So that one of theſe three ways, either by conducing to it or producing, or reducing of it, all the parts of Gods Word conſpire io this principal duty. The main divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Scripture is into the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</hi> But what is the deſign and drift of both theſe, but to reſcue or preſerve a Memory of God in the World? Our Saviour ſums up the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> in theſe two heads, <hi>the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Now what doth the Law ſerve for, if not to mind us of the great Law-giver, and to beget an awe of his Soveraignty upon the World? And the main end of the Prophets and their Propheſies, was to reproduce this Remembrance of God when the ungrateful People had forgot him. And what can be the end of that Light that hath ſhined

And the breach of a ſolemn Covenant or Contract, is ſinful in a higher degree, than the bare breach of Promiſe; becauſe in a Covenant there is a further motive to Truth and faithful performance, than in a meer Promiſe; for the advantage and emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he expects from the party with whom he hath contracted.

If thou be God, as they ſay thou art, revenge the wrong now done unto thy Name and Me, and ſhew thy Power upon thy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured People, who in their Deeds deny thee their God.</hi> Immediately after the King was ſlain, and all his Army routed, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Turkiſh Hiſtory.</hi> What a ſin is it then to violate an Oath, not made to Man but God himſelf, and that in a matter of the higheſt moment in the VVorld? (1.) Fealty and Allegiance to him from thoſe that are indebted to him, no leſs than all they have or hope for. And he that forgets God, breaks this Oath of Fealty and Allegiance, due to God for the meer benefits of his production and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance; but ſignally renewed and expreſſed in Baptiſm, for the mercy of Redemption by Chriſt, under whoſe Command we did then liſt our ſelves,

VVhoever thou art, that liveſt under the ſound of the Goſpel, and that haſt been ſprinkled with the VVater of Baptiſm.

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beſide the Bonds of <hi>Vow, Covenant</hi> and <hi>Oath,</hi> thou haſt the higher Obligations of a conſtant open <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> to ſhame thee for thine unmindfulneſs of God, which muſt needs be a greater aggravation of this ſin, becauſe it implies all the other and ſuperadds pretended reallity in all theſe, when it is nothing elſe but Hypocriſie, and deep Diſſimulation. It's the worſt ſort of Enmity that looks like Friendſhip; and he's an Adverſary to be abhor'd that's dreſt up like a Friend, and doth inſinuate into the Heart and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:134641:40"/>of him, whom he intends to betray by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Love and Friendſhip; and therefore <hi>David</hi> lays this ſort of injury more to heart than any that he received from open profeſſed Enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.12, 13, 14. <hi>For it was not an Enemy that reproached me, than I could have born it; neither was it he that hated me, that did magnifie himſelf againſt me, than I would have hid my ſelf from him: But it was thou O Man, mine Equal, my Guide and mine Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; we took ſweet Counſel together, and walked unto the Houſe of God in company.</hi> And mark what a Character he gives of ſuch a Perſon; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.20, 21. <hi>He hath put forth his hands againſt ſuch as be at peace with him; he hath broken his Covenant. The words of his Mouth were ſmoother than Butter, but War was in his Heart. His words were ſofter than Oyl, yet were they drawn Swords.</hi> There's none have done more miſchief in the Church of God, than ſuch as have profeſſed Love and ſeemed Friends. <hi>Judas</hi> gets into the neareſt outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that could be, and acts the greateſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs under the diſguiſe of a kiſs; and did that effectually, which the <hi>Herodians</hi> attempted with ſmooth words and pretenſions of friendſhip; but it's ſaid, <hi>Jeſus perceived their wickedneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed them, Mat.</hi> 22.18. And who have done the work of the Devil more effectually than thoſe that have profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians, that is devoted by Vow, Covenant and Oath to Chriſt, and yet by Hereſie have perverted the Chriſtian Faith, and by Schiſm have rent and torn his Church, and by Pride and Contention have ſet it all in a flame? And who were more bitter Enemies to Chriſt, in his Birth and Infancy,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:134641:40"/>than the Jews, who pretended to be the only People in Covenant with God, yet it's manifeſt from the moſt authentick Records and impartial Hiſtory, that they were the moſt bloody oppoſers and perſecutors of the Goſpel; and their fury was the hotter, becauſe it came under a mask of Zeal? And ſo induſtrious and implacable was their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Chriſtian Faith; and ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment was the Jewiſh Perſecution to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and propagation of the Goſpel, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity could not ſpread and grow to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe till this Enemy was taken away by a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Devaſtation; their Temple and City deſtroyed, and their Memorial periſhed from the Earth. Was it not a horrid aggravation of their Irreverence, Contempt, and wicked forgetfulneſs of God, that they were accompanied with ſuch a zealous Profeſſion of Love and Fidelity to him? The Character that <hi>Joſephus,</hi> their own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a moſt impartial Writer, gives of theſe men, that boaſted they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and the Children of the Promiſe is this, That their wickedneſs was grown to ſuch a height, that if they had not been ſwept away by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and deſtroyed in ſuch numbers, till none almoſt were left, the very Earth would have opened and ſwallowed them up.</p>
                     <p>It is a fearful ſin to oppoſe and fight againſt God, but to do it in the Garb and Habit of a Friend and Confederate (eſpecially if it be done with deſign) is ſuch a ſin, that will ſink the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters of it into deeper condemnation, than the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> will them. And profeſſed Enemies are like to ſcape better than
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:134641:41"/>theſe ſeeming Friends; and the more intimate and near the Friendſhip is that is profeſſed, the Treachery that doth accompany it is the more to be abhorred, and deſerves the blacker Character. What then can'ſt thou expect that God will ſay to thee, or how doſt thou think he will proceed againſt thee, that calleſt thy ſelf a Chriſtian, and reſteſt in thy Profeſſion, and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and knoweſt his Will, and approveſt the things that are moſt excellent, being inſtructed out of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18. And yet the love of Chriſt conſtraineth thee not to Repentance, Humility, and the Practice of thoſe Holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that he hath given thee; the warm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Compaſſion toward thee, doth not teach to order thy Converſation to the credit of the Goſpel. VVhat a Salutation doſt thou expect, when thou comeſt before the preſence of his Glory, and ſtandeſt among his Friends; if he call thee, as thou calleſt thy ſelf, and ſay, Friend how cameſt thou in hither? thou wilt but tremble the more at ſuch a word, that will have ſuch a dreadful ſentence at the heels, and be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſuch a terrible doom, as ſhall make thee to abhor a friend to all eternity, that deals ſo like an Enemy. O conſider this thou that forgeteſt God, and yet haſt bound thy ſelf ſo faſt by Vow, Covenant, Oath and Profeſſion, to remember him. If thoſe that take pains to imprint him upon their hearts day by day, by a freſh Remembrance of his amazing Goodneſs, ſhall ſcarce be ſaved, where ſhall ſuch a falſe, perfidious, perjur'd Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite as thou appear? Or how wilt thou be able to ſtand in Judgment? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. God will not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:134641:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>be mocked, neither can he be deceived; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth thy ſervice, and it is due to him, whether he have or have not thy conſent. But when thou doſt acknowledge what thou art indebted to him, and haſt vowed hearty Subjection and Obedience to him, and bound thy ſelf by all the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Bonds, thou canſt not but ſee thy ſin in forgetting him ſo well, and riſe higher, and bring a more heinous guilt upon thee.</p>

For a Man can riſe no higher than his end, no more than the VVater can above the Spring Head: God being caſt off, ſomething muſt

Then they ſhall pay dear for all their former forgetfulneſs of God, and their damnable inadvertency to his Word and Works. As it is a fearful thing to fall out of the rewarding hands of God, and to be forſaken and forgotten, ſo it is more dreadful to fall into the revenging hand of God, and to be ſo remembered. For as God is the beſt and moſt deſirable Friend, ſo he is the worſt and moſt formidable Enemy, and both theſe ways thou ſhalt rue thy contempt and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him. Thou ſhalt want him as thy friend when thou haſt the greateſt need, and have him
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:134641:47"/>as thine Enemy when thou art moſt afraid.

But he hath not left it to thy choice whether he ſhall abhor thee, yea, or not, or whether he ſhall recompence thy wickedneſs upon thine own head or not, if thou be found guilty; but will certainly lead thee forth with the workers of iniquity, and make thee know what it is to uſe thy memory for no higher matters than the World, and to put God to remember thee by forgetting him; and this will cure the wicked Lethargy and Stupidity of thy Soul, and make thee to remember him againſt thy will, even to all eternity; forget him then if thon canſt, as an angry and revenging Judge, when thou wilt not remember

I mean, that he is 1. Their <hi>Creator.</hi> 2. Their abſolute <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> whom they have the higheſt motives to obey. 3. That he is their <hi>Judge</hi> that muſt paſs the <hi>Sentence</hi> of everlaſting <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſery</hi> on them ere long. 4. That he that is thus related to them is <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient,</hi> and nothing they can think or do can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape his <hi>Eye.</hi> 5. That he is their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> without whoſe Favour and inward Grace they can never be at reſt.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. They that do not competently underſtand and conſider his works.</p>
                  <p>By competent I mean ſuch a degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge and conſideration of theſe, as doth 1. Turn their hearts from all Creatures to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:134641:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>God, and enable them deliberately and reſolvedly to chuſe him for their happineſs, which they can never do without a ſufficient or competent knowledge of theſe; and which they will do if they have a ſufficient knowledge and remembrance of theſe. 2. And turn their hearts to Chriſt, as the principal means to bring them to this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by his Laws directively, and by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit effectively. This I mean by competent, that which is ſufficient to theſe ends.</p>
                  <p>Now what degree and meaſure of knowledge and conſideration it is that's thus competent, it's not poſſible to define, becauſe it is not in all alike; with ſome a lower degree and meaſure of this knowledge and conſideration will make this charge, others need a higher meaſure, having ſtiffer Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to overcome. And as the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He that hath one of theſe marks hath all, and he that is guilty of theſe is forgetful of God. So that by theſe you may acquit or condemn your ſelves.</p>

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:134641:49"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> They that have not a higher and greater love to God than to any other thing elſe, are guilty and forgetters of him. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what we love we remember, and what we love beſt we remember moſt. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, what we do not love and care for we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; and the leſs we care for it the more we do forget it. Art thou one therefore that loveſt God above all, than he will have the higheſt place in thy Remembrance. I do not ſay he will be thought on as often as any thing elſe, becauſe God hath laid ſuch duty upon moſt of us that requireth more frequent Thoughts of other things than of him; but yet our thoughts of him will be frequent, and though they be fewer than our thoughts of other things, yet whatſoever their number be, they will more command the Affections and Actions than all other thoughts whatſoever, or elſe we ſhall come under the dreadful guilt of forgetfulneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou art a forgetter of God, if any one ſin do habitually prevail in thee, and do lead thee captive for the moſt part, becauſe this will extinguiſh the love of God in thee, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all worthy Remembrance of him. Art thou one therefore that alloweſt thy ſelf in any one ſin? then thou art a forgetter of God; or if thou doſt not trouble thy ſelf with ſuch thoughts, nor doſt much matter what prevails, rather any thing than puzzle thy ſelf with reflections on thy ſelf; thou forgetteſt thy ſelf, and therefore muſt needs forget God. For the knowledge of thy own neceſſities, of which ſin is the greateſt, is one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary requiſite to the due Remembrance of God.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:134641:50"/>
                  <p>But I intend not to inſiſt on theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As I <hi>implied before,</hi> if thou haſt a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Remembrance of God, thou doſt competently underſtand and conſider the ordinary works of God. So <hi>I ſay now,</hi> Thou wilt much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and obſerve the extraordinary works of his Hand, and applaud his Juſtice when his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are more ſignal. The reaſon is, becauſe theſe are more apt to provoke conſideration, which is ready to ſleep when things run on in a conſtant courſe and order. And therefore who is it that makes any matter of a River that runs on a conſtant ſtream or courſe? But if it ſtop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any viſible cauſe, all the Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey comes to behold it. Who regards the Sun, Moon and Stars, that are obvious to our daily Eye? Or the orderly ſite and motion of them? They are but few; but if there appear two Suns or two Moons, or a Star extraordinary, never ſeen before, what running and gazing every where; and they that will ſcarce ſtep out of doors to behold an ordinary Star, will break their Sleep and loſe their Reſt, and venture their Health to ſee a dreadful Comet or Blazing ſtar. The like may be ſaid for the motion of them who minds the daily riſing and ſetting of the Sun? But if it ſhould ſtand ſtand ſtill a day, or go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ten degrees, as it did in the days of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah, Joſhua</hi> 10.13. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.11. Who would not take notice? God will not be ſlighted in his ordinary daily works; but when he doth a Miracle, or a ſtrange and unuſual Work,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:134641:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>he calls for a more ſpecial attention and reverent obſervation. It's ſinful not to go on and not to lift up an Eye and acknowledge God and obſerve his VViſdom and Power in his common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; but it's wicked ſtupidity not to ſtop and conſider Providences that rarely come to paſs and ſeldom fall out. Doth not every extraordinary act of Juſtice call out and ſay? <hi>Come behold and ſee what Deſolations he hath wrought in the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 46.8. VVhen he is ſhaking a Nation by VVar, and overturning the Glory of it; or when ſcourging a Nation with Peſtilence or Famine, he doth in effect ſay, <hi>Be ſtill and know that I am God, I will be exalted amongſt them, I will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in them, or on them, Pſal.</hi> 46.10. Juſtice is one of his eſſential Perfections, and when that is cleared and ſin made odious, by remarkable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and the devouring evils that it uſhers in, then God is acknowledged and glorified.</p>
                  <p>And when this is done by the voluntary act of thoſe that feel the hand, it's an act of terrible affrighting Juſtice in the beginning, but glorious, wonderful, and moſt endearing mercy in the end. The Lord is now throwing us by heaps into the place of forgetfulneſs, becauſe we have ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably forgotten him; Who hath fed us with the fineſt of the VVheat and Honey out of the Rock, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.14. I mean with the bleſſings of Heaven and Earth, and doth he not expect that we ſhould be ſilent and meditate terror; <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.18. And applaud his Juſtice and Holineſs, and that our Bowels ſhould more yearn over the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed cauſe and intereſt of Holineſs, which our ſin hath injured, than the Carcaſes of our deareſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:134641:51"/>Friends, that fall like Dung upon the Earth. It is moſt certainly true, that every honeſt faithful heart, that's ſincerely dedicated unto God, and which God will own hereafter, that he is more heartily troubled in his deliberate thoughts, for the wrong ſin hath done to God, than for the ſaddeſt calamity it brings upon men. VVhat man that hath the love of God and Holineſs predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in his Heart, that can particularly think of the ſins of this Nation and the City, which is the chief Theatre of this preſent Judgment, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, groſs and open Prophaneneſs, perfidious Hipocriſie, ſhameful Ingratitude, beaſtly Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Contempt both of Mercy and Judgment, Pride of both ſorts, Spirit and Fleſh, Luxury, Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; and with what a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick impudent Face they are committed, and that after ſuch Obligations ſo freſh before our Eyes. VVhat true Child of God can conſider this and not cry out in ſome true ſenſe of Gods diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? <hi>My Bowels, my Bowels, I am pained at the very Heart, my Heart maketh a noiſe within me, Jer.</hi> 4.19. And though he doth compaſſionate the ſuffering Nation, and thoſe in particular that feel this ſeverity, yet conſideration forceth him to ſay from his Soul, <hi>Thy way and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee, for thy wickedneſs is bitter, it reacheth to the very Heart, Jer.</hi> 4.18. VVe have liv'd under excellent light and means in a Nation, where our deareſt Saviour hath been made known this 1600 years (1.) Almoſt from his very Paſſion, and we have liv'd under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, and have acknowledged our high engagement to love and obedience of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:134641:51"/>How frequent have the obliging names of Saviour and Redeemer been in our Mouths? and our Lips have droped free Grace and Mercy, like the Honey-comb, and our words to him have been ſmoother than Oyl; and yet what could we have done more wickedly than we have done, if we had no Faith at all? If we had been meer Heathens, and looked for no other Life? and if we had no fear of Judgment? Nay, have we ſtuck at thoſe ſins that Turks and Heathens do abhor? It's a true, though a ſhameful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And now ſhall we pity a ſuffering, and not abhor a ſinful People? Hath the Lord broke in upon us before many a fair warning; we have had <hi>ubera</hi> many times, before we have felt <hi>verbera;</hi> we have had lightning before thunder. Are not all theſe Examples that he hath ſet before us, both in ſacred and prophane Writ, ſo many Warning-pieces ſhot off to prevent the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy? Doth he not ſay to us, by his Word, as he did to the Rebellious Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Go ye now unto Shiloe, where I ſet my Name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my People Iſrael. Go ye to the City and Temple of Jeruſalem, and ſee what I have done for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs thereof.</hi> Go ye to <hi>Sodom,</hi> to the old World, ſee how their ſins have found them out. Conſult the ſeveral Nations, to which the Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their ſeveral burdens, and ſee how they have ſped for their Iniquities. Caſt thine Eye upon <hi>Greece,</hi> and other parts of Chriſtendom, upon whom the Lord hath let in the overflowing Scourge; the barbarous <hi>Turk</hi> for their kicking at his Sacrificies, and negligence in his Worſhip.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:134641:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>Look upon <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Lord made ſuch fearful Deſolation; time not yet out of mind. Remember the late unnatural War and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in our own Nation; how it emptied the Nation, plagued the Inhabitants; for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs burneth as the fire; it ſhall devour the Bryers and Thorns, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.18. How long hath the Lord waited on us, expecting fruit, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Reformation. Think not that the Lord dealeth hardly; charge him not fooliſhly if he call for the Sicle, for the Harveſt is ripe, the Preſſes are full, the Fats overflow, for our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are riſen high, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.13. What could the Lord have done more for us in a way of mercy than he hath done, and therefore no wonder that Judgment follow us! Thus if thou haſt a worthy Remembrance of God, thou wilt conſider his more remarkable Providences, and plead the cauſe of his Juſtice, in the preſent ſad condition into which ſin hath brought us.</p>

                  <p>If then it be ſuch a ſin to forget God, as there hath been proof enough it is, then let this ſtir us up to more frequent thoughts of God, and to a more worthy <hi>Remembrance</hi> of him. What ſuch a Remembrance doth import I think I need not waſte time to ſhew, ſince it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to forgetfulneſs; and contraries do diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver each other; by theſe two known and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rules, 1. Contraries in or about the ſame Subject, and the ſubject of the one is neither larger nor ſcanter than the other <hi>(e. g.)</hi> Sight
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:134641:52"/>and Blindneſs are about the Eye. The ſame Air is the Subject both of Light and Darkneſs, and Vertue and Vice are ſubjected in the ſame Soul, though not at the ſame time. 2. Though Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are about the ſame Subject, yet they have contrary Affections <hi>(e. g.)</hi> If Vertue be lovely, Vice is Odious. If Light diſcovers all things, than Darkneſs covers all things. Since therefore, 1. As I ſaid, Forgetfulneſs is not an act of the Memory only, ſo neither is Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. And 2. As every degree of Remembrance doth not acquit a Man from the odious guilt of Forgetfulneſs, ſo neither is every degree of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs inconſiſtent with this Remembrance. If God have the Soveraignty and Preheminence in thy Heart, he will accept it, otherwiſe it is not a Remembrance worthy of him. I need ſay no more, for if we know what it is to <hi>forget God,</hi> we cannot but know what is to <hi>Remember him.</hi> If we know who they are that forget God, we muſt needs know who they are that Remember him. But leaſt what hath been ſpoken ſhould not be ſo Remembered and ſet together, I ſhall only give a ſhort draught of the Duty, or rather bring it freſh to your Remembrance, that you may know whether the Exhortation tendeth, and not be excited to you know not what.</p>

                     <hi>This Remembrance of God, implies ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and worthy thoughts of God, as command the Affections of our Hearts, and the Actions of our Lives, more than any thing elſe beſides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is it not pity that the Heart of Man ſhould be ſo backward to this duty, and ſo hardly prompted to ſuch a ſightly and becoming work; and that all that can be ſpoke to recommend this duty, and to ſpur up to this Remembrance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God ſet it home, is like to be at beſt, but like the beating or cutting the Air, which ſeems to receive a wound, but it preſently cloſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and no abiding impreſſion is left behind. Alas! alas! that we ſhould ſtuff our Hearts with Feathers, and think upon vanity and never tire; and that the bias of our Souls ſhould be quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way than towards God! That he that ſhould be our ſweeteſt Meditation is ſo great a ſtranger to us! How ſeldom do we erect a thought to him, or think on him with pleaſure and delight!

But he that is our ſupport all the day long, is ever about our Paths and about our Bed, for our defence and ſafety, hath a poor little ſhare in our Thoughts and Affections. Art thou not fully ſatisfied that he is to be loved with all thy <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and that he is worthy of Love and Obedience, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fold more than thou art able to give?

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:134641:53"/>better employ our Thoughts, than upon him that gave us our <hi>Thinking Faculty?</hi> To what better purpoſe canſt thou uſe thy Reaſon, than to fetch ſomething from every Object that is preſented to thee, to put thee in mind of God? Every thing is big with Inſtruction, and proffers its help to bring thee nearer unto God, if thou wilt be taught. Thou canſt take no better courſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thy ſelf than to advance him in thy thoughts. Thou canſt make no better uſe of Creatures, than to make them a means to bring God and thy Heart together. <hi>To the Heavens and to the Earth,</hi> and to all that is in them, and if they teach thee not this Leſſon, it is becauſe they are Traytors and not Creatures; but the fault is thine and not theirs. Thou canſt not make a better uſe of Scripture than to imprint God deeper in thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. <hi>To the Laws and to the Teſtimonies,</hi> if they teach thee not thus much, it is becauſe thou wilt not learn, and there is no light in thee, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.20. As thou loveſt thy ſelf and thine own welfare, make thine advantage of every thing, to promote him higher in thy Mind and Heart. Since thou haſt ſo much Inſtruction round about thee to bring God to thy Remembrance, and ſuch a light both in Nature and in Scripture to diſcover it, and ſuch Aſſiſtance to fetch it in by Meditation into thine Underſtanding and Affections, and ſuch opportunities to learn what is thus ſuggeſted, and when there is ſuch ſweetneſs in the very act of Learning, and the benefits that directly flow from thence are ſo incomparable, the final reward ſo unſpeakable; refuſe not to apply thy Heart to the higheſt Wiſdom! All other thoughts that are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:134641:54"/>not ſubordinate to this Remembrance, have a greater or leſſer tendency to diſcontent and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but theſe are the only comforting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Meditations. If thou doſt not forget thy ſelf thou wilt remember him. If thou doſt not forget thy later end, thou wilt remember him. If thou wilt but remember the days of Anguiſh and Trouble that are coming on thee, thou wilt remember him. Thou wilt then ſay, be not far from me when trouble is near and there is none to help. O let him not be far from thee now, keep him in the midſt of thy Heart, renew thy thoughts of him as thou ſitteſt in thy Houſe, as thou walkeſt by the way, as thou lieſt down, and as thou riſeſt up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.8. Imagine thou ſeeſt him in his Word. Suppoſe that thou beholdeſt him in his Works; think thou haſt a taſte of him, whilſt thou art feeding thy ſelf, and refreſhing thy Body with its daily Food and Suſtenance. For thou liveſt not by Bread alone, nor by ſuch dead things as theſe, but by the Word and Bleſſing of God, that only can give thee life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.3.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Doth God remember thee every hour, and canſt thou make ſhift for all that not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him? If thou didſt not need the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens that hang over thy Head, nor the Earth that hangeth under thy Feet, nor any of thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that ſtand round about thee. If thou wouldſt ſpare the light and influence of the Sun, and want the Air that's turned in and out at thy Noſtrils, and keep in the little ſpark of Life, without the Meat and Drink that feedeth it every Day, and the hot Embers that cover it every Night, I mean the warm Bed and Sleep wherewith it is cheriſhed and refreſhed, or if thou couldſt bid all Creatures to go and come at thy pleaſure, then it were a more excuſable ſin not to remember God; but when it is ſo great a certainty that theſe are all the means and inſtruments that he hath made, and doth uſe to conveigh his Bleſſings to us, and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live a moment without one or other of them, thou art an Atheiſt in Judgment or Practice if thou forget him. Thou mayſt as well ſtand without a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:134641:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>Foundation, or ſee without Eyes, or hear without the hearing Faculty, as live without one or other of his Mercies every moment. If thou hadſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to endear the thoughts of God to thee, and to make the Remembrance ſweet, even the mercies of a <hi>meer private nature,</hi> have a mighty force to one that doth but conſider them. If we do but acknowledge what we have deſerved, it's no contemptible mercy, nor to be ſlighted, to be freed from thoſe evils which are ſo many ways incident to us, and which we have ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not to be ſtricken with Blindneſs or Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to be ſmitten with Diſtraction or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not forſaken of Health and Friends, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comforts; not driven to pinching neceſſities of Hunger, Thirſt, Cold, and Nakedneſs, as many are. Theſe privative mercies ſhould amplifie the goodneſs of our Redeemer to us, and make the thoughts of God more welcome. Not to want any Member of thy Body, nor Faculty of thy Soul, nor a very good portion of Food, Health and Friends eſpecially, if they be Friends indeed, nor other Proviſion for a comfortable Life; and yet to want an Eye to look to the Fountain, nor to remember the Giver that deals with us ſo contrary to our deſervings, is a fearful caſe and condition. The Church in her Captivity, when ſhe was in the hands of cruel Tyrants and Oppreſſors, yet even in that condition, could find out a <hi>Not</hi> that did not a little affect his Heart with thankfulneſs. It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. As if ſhe had ſaid, we are in diſtreſs, but we might have been in Hell; we are caſt down, but we might have been utterly caſt off. A
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:134641:55"/>Soul truly convinced of his ſin and humbled, knows the value of ſuch mercies as theſe. Not tormented with thoſe acute Diſeaſes that gives us no reſt day nor night; not afflicted with the Stone or Gout, or Iliack Paſſion; not ſeized on with a hand of Judgment from Heaven; not viſited with the Plague, or any other dreadful Sickneſs. What an Indictment made up of ſuch Mercies, might be drawn up againſt one that blots God out of his Remembrance? And if mercies of this kind are ſuch an obligation to this duty, what are the poſitive mercies of a whole life, yea, of a year, month, or but a day. It's hard to reckon up the kinds and ſorts, unleſs we ſhould inſiſt upon meer generals, that comprehend numbers under them. Such as are Temporal, Spiritual, Perſonal or Relative, it's not very eaſie to reckon them up. The comforts of Life, Health to thoſe that have it, Eſtate, Name, mercies of Food and Rayment, Friends, Houſe, Recreation, Protection; but the particulars under theſe who can recite? Our relative mercies how various? Never a one relation but would puzzle our thoughts to muſter up the mercies thereof, and give in the particulars; the good we do them, the good we receive of them, every ſight of them, every enjoyment of their company, diſcourſe, love to us, our love to them. In a word, All our comforts are theirs, and theirs reciprocally ours, and ſo each have the mercies twice over. See now whether we have brought the matter, and in what a wood we have loſt our ſelves in. Thus it is if we count but for a day, but if we go further and reckon for the month or year, we ſhall find
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:134641:56"/>no end. Who can count the Duſt of <hi>Jacob? Num.</hi> 23.10. or ſum up the mercies he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, which are like the Duſt of the Earth; not for ſmalneſs, but for multitude. <hi>David</hi> obſerves them to come by whole loads, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.19. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with his Benefits.</hi> But our Spiritual Miſeries are yet more, becauſe they contain all our Temporals, ſo far as they refer to a Spiritual end, and how many more who can tell? How many mercies concur in our Redemption, Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? How many conſiderations may be fetch'd from the Author, from the meritorious cauſe, from the perſons that do receive, from the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that do convey them, from the frequency and reiteration of the particulars; and from other circumſtances of time and place, which would ſwell our Accounts beyond all poſſibility of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration? This is the firſt motive, the infinite mercies we receive ſhould prompt us to, <hi>this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memembrance.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wouldſt thou have God remember thee with compaſſion in thy greateſt neceſſities, then remember him with affection now? It may be there are fearful days coming upon ſome of us, before our <hi>final departure</hi> and <hi>ſolemn appearance,</hi> before the Judge of all the World. What though the Cloud that hangs over this Nation be but the bigneſs of a mans hand, it may quickly grow big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and blacker till it cover the face of the whole Heaven, and bring down a ſtorm of heavier mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery upon thoſe that have eſcaped Judgment hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. There is nothing can fenſe a man from all poſſible Fears and Terrors if God forget us.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:134641:56"/>Wouldſt thou not be afraid of evil tidings, nor faint when the iniquities of thy heels compaſs thee about? Wouldſt thou not be confounded in the day of adverſity, when the Heaven frowns, the Sea roars, <hi>Eſay</hi> 24.20. <hi>And the Earth ſhall reel to and fro and ſtagger like a drunken man, when the world ſhall be overturned, and the tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy on it, and the hearts of wicked men ſhall fail them for fear.</hi> Then keep alive ſuch remembrance of him, as hath been hitherto commended. Then come what will, nothing ſhall drive thee to deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for the Lord God ſhall be thy confidence and with-hold thine heart from ſinking, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.26. as well as thy foot from being taken. This a great Cardinal in this Nation, underſtood when it was too late; and therefore when a Meſſenger from <hi>Henry</hi> 8. brought him the tidings of his doom, and was ſent to bring him away to Execution, he piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully complained, <hi>That if he had ſerved God as faithfully as he had endeavoured to ſerve his Maſter, he had never met with ſuch a reward.</hi> As it is the top ſtone, and the perfection of miſery to be blotted out of Gods Remembrance, ſo it is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs worth a World to be Remembred by him. This ſupported <hi>David</hi> many a time, when he was in miſerable diſtreſs, and brought to the greateſt ſtreights, when Friends forſook him, Enemies threatned him; <hi>Saul</hi> hunted him like a Patridge about the Mountains, and he was forced to flee from before his Face, and to take Shelter amongſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> whoſe Champion he had ſlain, and from whom he had little reaſon to expect any ſuccour; and whilſt he liv'd in baniſhment at <hi>Ziglag,</hi> even that was ſuddenly ſurprized by the

                     <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and burnt with Fire, and his Wives and Friends were taken away Captives; and the People that were his only Guard, being provoked, ſpake of ſtoning him. But though all this had been enough to have broken the heart of another man, not acquainted with <hi>David</hi>'s refuge, yet ſee how <hi>David</hi> bore up and ſupported himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. <hi>And David was greatly diſtreſſed, for the People ſpake of ſtoning him, becauſe the Soul of all the People was grieved, every Man for his Sons and for his Daughters. But David encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> This helped <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to digeſt the proud meſſage of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and to ſpread the railing Letter before him, who he knew could put a Hook into <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Noſe, and turn him back, or elſe defend him againſt that Army that were grown ſo inſolent by their Victories, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. And God remembred him, <hi>verſe</hi> 21, 22. Yea, when <hi>Eſaiah</hi> was ſent to him to bid him put his Houſe in order and prepare for death, it was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Proof to him againſt the terror of death, that he could ſay, <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight;</hi> which he could ne'r have done if God had not been higheſt in his Remembrance, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.3. If thou beeſt one that canſt drive out the thoughts of God in thy youthful, healthful, and more comfortable days, expect not that he ſhould remember thee in diſtreſs. If whilſt thou art ſurrounded with his mercies, thou wilt forget that he is gracious to thee; when thou art be ſet with miſery and affliction, he will forget to be gracious to thee. Be wiſe now therefore, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:134641:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>take in theſe thoughts, as thou takeſt in the Air every day, and other comforts which he ſendeth thee, and lay them up as thy greateſt treaſure. Theſe will ſweeten the ſowreſt Cup, and gild over the bittereſt Pill, and God will certainly remember thee, if not to take away the evil, yet take out the ſting. <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> may forget <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> and the Butler may be unmindful of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the preſerved City may not remember the poor man that ſaved it; but God will not forget thoſe that remember him. He will be thy refuge and ſtrength, and a very preſent help in the time of trouble; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1. And then thou needſt not fear, though the Earth be removed, and the Mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea; though the Waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the Mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. Then though thy Fleſh begins to fail thee, yet thy heart will not; or if thy Fleſh ſhould fail thee and thy Heart alſo, yet God would remember thee and be the ſtrength of thy hope and thy portion for ever. Thou mayſt eaſily foreſee the day when Sickneſs will break thy Body, and earthly Delights will forſake thee, and Death will be inexorable and take no nay: then if thou haſt cheriſhed this Remembrance of God, thou wilt dare to lay down thy Body in the Duſt, and as certainly foreſee the joyful re-union of thy Soul and Body, as now thou doſt their uncomfortable diſſolution. Wouldſt thou not then be forgotten of God, when thy Friends and all the World will forget thee? Then Remember him now. Yea, wouldſt thou be content to go into the place of Forgetfulneſs, and to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:134641:58"/>as a dead man out of ſight? Why, all this will not diſcourage thee, if thou haſt this remedy at hand. But on the contrary, How unprepared is the Man that forgets God, for his eternal ſtate? How loath to leave the Twig and fall into the Ocean? With what regret and reluctancy, with what an aking, trembling Heart, doth he look upon Death; who can blame ſuch a Man if he hang back, and dare not launch forth into Eternity? And therefore it's ſaid in the <hi>Proverbs, The wicked is driven hence.</hi> How unwilling doth he bid farewel to his dear injoyments? How loath to part with the Wife out of his Boſom, the Children out of his Arms? He cannot bear ſuch a loſs.

Such a one as I am now ſpeaking of, there's nothing here below that's worth an act of our Underſtanding or Will, that's worth a Thought or an Embrace, but as they lead to a more perfect Knowledge and Union, and are a means ſuited to our neceſſity, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any Knowledge worthy of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

What a ſhame is it then to let <hi>ſenſe</hi> go before and no <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> follow after. To pore upon the Letters, and not to mind the ſenſe and meaning of them. To exerciſe an act upon the viſible Creatures, without a following Act by way of inference and deduction to the inviſible God? What folly, to dote upon the Letters, and not to regard the meaning of them, and to loſe our underſtanding in a maze of inſignificant things that ſtand for nothing, if they teach not the knowledge of him that animates all things, and is the end and ſignification of them. What is there in Man or any other Creature, that thou ſhouldſt make an Idol of it, and that thou ſhouldſt ſet it up in thine Heart, and proſtrate thine Affections to it? Is there any thing that deſerves the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a being every way full and perfect, in which thou mayeſt <hi>acquieſce,</hi> but God? Yet if he have not the Remembrance I am preſſing to, ſomething elſe will ſtrike in and ſupply his abſence, and uſurp thine Affections. And be it what it will beſides, it is but a Reed or an Arm of Fleſh that's got ſo high in thine eſteem; and then thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Curſed be the Man that truſteth in Man,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:134641:59"/>and maketh Fleſh his Arm, and whoſe Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from the Lord. For he ſhall be like the Heath in the Deſart, and ſhall not ſee when good cometh,</hi> Jer. 17.5, 6. All-ſufficiency, Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and indefectible Fidelity, are proper to God alone. It's no wonder for the Sun to ſet and be eclipſed, as glorious a body as it is. It's no marvel if all Creatures prove Liars, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. and ſhew themſelves untruſty and deceitful. As it is their nature to deceive, ſo it is our ſin and folly to lean hard on them, and be deceived by them. Thou mayſt as wiſely expect that the Wind ſhould always blow from the ſame quarter, and ſit in the ſame corner, as that any created Being ſhould afford thee conſtant help, and never ſhame thee. But the portion of <hi>Jacob</hi> is not like theſe changeable things. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>David) and were delivered. They hoped in thee and were not confounded,</hi> Pſal. 22.4, 5. Let him that is void of underſtanding run to ſomething elſe, and remember it with greateſt pleaſure, and repoſe his truſt in a lie, and adore a ſilly Man that can but promote him to Riches and Honour. Mark what will be the iſſue, may be, when thou art juſt expecting the fruit of ſinful truſt, his Breath goeth forth, here turneth to his Earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh. May I not well ſay therefore, <hi>Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, that remembreth the Lord his God.</hi> He that is fond of any thing here below, and ſetteth his Heart upon it, and ſuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:134641:59"/>himſelf a fool, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. His warm thoughts that ſit upon vanity all the day long, ſhall never hatch and produce the thing he expected, nor any thing that will look like happineſs, when his Judgment ſhall come to more maturity. Why then is God ſo ſeldom in thy thoughts, why art thou no more delighted in the Remembrance of him? Why doth he dwell no more in thy Meditations? Art thou willing to be deceived and labour in vain, and to lie down in fruſtration and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? If thou couldſt name any thing under Heaven that were not chargeable with a thouſand Imperfections, and were not liable to the Moth and Ruſt. If thou couldſt aſſure thy ſelf that thy Friend will never prove perfidious, that thy Lovers will always bear thee the ſame Affection, which thou imagineſt now they do. If Youth and Health, and Life, would laſt ten times longer than they are like to do, yet when the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies between God and them, it's folly and madneſs to prefer anything in thy Remembrance before him.</p>
                  <p>I might here ſingle out the things that are moſt attractive of Mens Affections, and have indeed the higheſt eſteem and love in a Carnal Heart, and then produce the <hi>ſeveral diſparagements</hi> they are liable to, when they are compared with an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Independant, and All-ſufficient Being.

                  <p>Conſider then, what Obligations thou ſin'ſt againſt, if thou ſhut God out of thy Remembrance.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:134641:60"/>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>On God</hi>'s <hi>part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He gave thee thy Faculties to this very end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And hath purpoſely ſet Heaven and Earth before thee to exerciſe theſe Faculties, and to put thee in Remembrance of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath ſent his Son to put thee in mind of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath given thee his Spirit, Word, and all his Ordinances, to awake thee to remember him. Think then what Gilt, the breach of all theſe Obligations on Gods part will bring upon thee, if yet thou ſhalt forget him.</p>
                  <p>Conſider what Obligations alſo thou ſinneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. 2. <hi>On thy own part.</hi> Thou ſinneſt againſt 1. Thy ſolomn Vow. 2. Covenant. 3. Oath 4. Profeſſion. If theſe particulars be taken into thy conſideration, thou wilt not ſure count it a <hi>venial ſin</hi> to forget God, and conſequently it will be a means to bring thee to the Remembrance I am directing to. <hi>Conſider</hi> alſo, the danger as well as the guiltineſs of this ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may betray thee to all other ſin and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will provoke God to forget thee in a way of mercy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will cauſe him to Remember thee in a way of Judgment. If thon art one that doſt believe and wilt conſider thus much, it will prepare thee for the duty we are now upon, and be a help to a worthy Remembrance of him. For every thing that hath the nature of a motive to a practical Duty, hath the nature of a means or help to the performance of the Duty. The Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:134641:61"/>cauſe it is a neceſſary means to any Duty, to bring the Will to a thorough Reſolution. Now all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are the moſt proper means ro bring the Will to ſuch a Determination.</p>
                  <p>So much for the firſt thing that we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider alſo what a ſhame it is to forget God, and to be unmindful of him. Haſt thou no ingenuity?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Canſt thou forget him that remembreth thee every hour?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Canſt thou forget him in proſperity whom thou wilt remember in thy neceſſity?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doſt thou not bluſh to prefer empty, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory and tranſitory things in thy Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before God.</p>
                  <p>But theſe things I have already inſiſted on, and therefore do but now name them as matter of our conſideration, as a ſecond ſort of motives, and therefore fit means to help on this Remembrance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If thou wouldſt be in the number of thoſe that exalt God above all things in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, then conſider what <hi>advantage</hi> will accrue to thee by ſuch a Remembrance. I know theſe may be alſo called motives, as <hi>all means by way of conſideration are.</hi> But yet they are all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and different kinds of motives, and have their effect upon three ſeveral paſſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt ſort, taken from the conſideration of the greatneſs and danger of the ſin of not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring God, are rather to fright us from the ſin of forgetfulneſs, than to draw us to the duty of Remembrance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort are intended to work upon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:134641:61"/>Ingenuity, where there is any, and to excite ſhame in thoſe that neglect ſuch a becoming duty</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the third ſort, taken from the benefits and advantage of this Remembrance, are directly to excite Love and Deſire, and hereby to attract the Heart to the performance of a work ſo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</p>
                  <p>I come now therefore to propoſe the <hi>Benefits</hi> that will follow ſuch a worthy Remembrance of God, as a means to this duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt Conſider,</hi> If thou art one that Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt God with the moſt prizing, valuing thoughts; thou art <hi>tranſlated from Death to Life.</hi> If St. <hi>John</hi> make the predominant love of the Brethren to be ſo ſure an evidence of this Tranſlation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> Then much more doth the ſincere love of God give us full ſecurity, that we are thus advanced. But the predominant love of God is implied in this Remembrance as the eſſential part of it, according to the known Rule, words of Senſe and Underſtanding in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity, eſſentially involve Affections and Actions. (If they go alone) all moral Acts are incompleat) unleſs they be both in the underſtanding and will in the Mind and Heart. If therefore thou art one that thus remembreſt God, thou haſt this grand priviledge, whoſe name is <hi>Legion,</hi> and contains ſuch a number under it. Death is a name of terror, and ſounds dreadful to all, whoſe Ears it hath not ſtop'd, and is the ſum and abridgment of all that's either <hi>hateful</hi> or <hi>fearful.</hi> And therefore all the penalty that God threatneth for the breach of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:134641:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuch a perfect Righteous Law, as he gave to Man, was comprized in the word <hi>Death.</hi> And if it be not enough to vindicate the Law from contempt of ſuch as do but hear it, yet it will teach them (at leaſt) not to deſpiſe it that feel it. And as Death is a Name pregnant with Dread and Horror; ſo Life is the moſt comfortable Sound, and carries all that's deſirable in the Bowels of it. And it is put in Scripture to ſignifie, 1. All Happineſs, 2. Perpetuity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the only Sanction that God added to his Law, by way of Remuneration, <hi>Do this and Live.</hi> Where Life is oppoſed to the Death that is threatned to the Tranſgreſſors. As Death therefore is comprehenſive of all Miſery, ſo Life is a complication of all Happineſs. And as it is put for all Felicity, ſo for Perpetuity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.7. In his favour is Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (1.) Perpetuity, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the oppoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> in the former part of the verſe. His Anger endures but a moment, that is, it's ſhort, but in his Favour is Life (1.) It's laſting and perpetual. Now Death is of three ſorts, oppoſed to a three fold Life, 1. <hi>Natural.</hi> 2. <hi>Moral.</hi> 3. <hi>Metaphorical. Natural Death</hi> is the privation of all ſenſe. <hi>Death Moral</hi> is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Love in the Will to Vertue, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to Goodneſs, for want of which Love it is dead to all vertuous Life and Action, and feels no ſweetneſs in them, becauſe the principle of that Life is wanting. For <hi>Love is the Principium Vitae in morallibus.</hi> Love is the principle of Life in the Moral, Spiritual, or gracious Life. And as Natural Death doth not only deprive the Body of all Senſe and Motion, but renders it unfit for the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:134641:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>Soul to dwell in and be united to, and ſo diſſolves the union between theſe two. So Morally Death doth not deprive the Soul of all gracious and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Senſe and Motion, but renders it unfit for the Spirit of true Vertue, Grace and Holineſs to dwell in; and ſo there muſt needs follow a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce and Separation between them. And as in the Natural Life there is a Union between the Soul and Body, ſo in the Moral there is a Union between the Soul and God. <hi>Death Metaphorical</hi> is the privation of all the comfortable effects of Life, whether it be Natural or Moral, whilſt bear Life doth ſtill remain, and the preſence of all thoſe evils that may afflict or imbitter it.</p>
                  <p>And all theſe are either

                  <p>From what hath been ſpoken for the explication of theſe two terms, <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> you may perceive what a priviledge and unſpeakable favour it is to be tranſlated from Death to Life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If thou Remembreſt God, The ſting of a Natural Death is pulled out, and though thou art not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> from the part of the penalty of ſin, whereby the Body is deprived of all ſenſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Soul, yet thou art delivered from that which is moſt terrible in Death. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the miſery or Death that will follow after, and it is a comfortable paſſage for them that Remember God, to endleſs Joy and Happineſs; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a welcome Meſſenger to them. They may truly ſay as <hi>Agag,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.32. <hi>The bitterneſs of Death is paſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:134641:63"/>
                  <p n="2">2. They are tranſlated from the Death of Sin to the Life of Grace and Holineſs, and are united unto God, and are diſpoſed by Faith and Love to that Holineſs, which is the Divine Perfection, and the way to the higheſt Happineſs and Honour that the Heart of Man can wiſh or deſire. Though this Life will be imperfect whilſt we ſtay here. And if there be ſuch pleaſure in the Union between the Soul and Body, then there is much more in the Union between the Soul and God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Death is put for Miſery and the bitter and uncomfortable effects of the endleſs Life to come, ſo they are paſſed from Death to Life. The Sentence of Death that God hath paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, is ſo far revers'd. And as for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and Evils of this Life though materially, they may have more than other Men, yet as to the formal and moſt eſſential part of them, they feel them not ſo much as other Men, becauſe they are allay'd and ſweetned. 1. By the inward Peace and Comfort that God gives to thoſe that Remember him. 2. By the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they get by thoſe outward Sufferings. For as their outward Man is afflicted, ſo their inward man is renewed, ſtrengthened and confirmed day by day, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. For their light Affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, even in the beginnings of it here, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.3.

                  <p>If thou art one in whoſe Remembrance God is advanced above all other things, thou ſhalt not

O what a Mercy is it to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the power of Death and Darkneſs, and to be tranſlated into the Kingdom of his <hi>dear Son,</hi> where thou ſhalt grow up from one degree of Life to another, till thou come to everlaſting Life, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. At thy firſt entrance into this Kingdom, Death is ſentenced, and ſome execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is done upon every ſort of Death, which will be perfected, as this remembrance of God grows up to perfection in thee. <hi>O Death I will be thy Plague, O Grave I will be thy Deſtruction,</hi> Hoſ. 13.14. Which as it was verified of Chriſt perſonally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, ſo it is of Chriſt myſtically underſtood. (1.) As Chriſt overcame Death in his Perſon, ſo every true Believer (ſuch are all and only they that have God in their Remembrance) hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſome conqueſt over Death, which ſhall grow up to a full Victory; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in the Name of the whole Church, doth acknowledge this mercy; <hi>Thanks be to God that giveth us the victory, thorough our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 5, 7. Whilſt the wicked forgetters of God are <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſins, and dead to all ſoul and ſolid Joy and Comfort, and deſigned to an eternal death. Thou that thinkeſt upon God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt his Love in Chriſt, art entred into a ſtate of Life, and haſt ſuch a Promiſe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more in it than all the rich <hi>Indian</hi> Mines.

                  <p>This one priviledge of being tranſlated from Death to Life, is big with a number more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It implies that thou art reconciled to God, and he is at peace with thee, and thou needeſt no more to fear him as thine Enemy. All his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Power, Juſtice, Holineſs, Vengeance, Majeſty, that ſound ſo terrible to the forgetters of God, do but the better ſecure thee of thine Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It implies alſo thy preſent Juſtification, in title of Law. God hath acquitted thee by the law of Grace and Act of the Goſpel, from the guilt of ſin, and diſſolved the Obligation to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If thou art one that Remembreſt God, all things ſhall co-operate and conſpire for thy good. Every Age, every ſtate and condition of Life, every Place and Company, every Change and Alteration in the World, Proſperity and Adverſity, Friends and Enemies, Health and Sickneſs, Honour and Diſhonour; every Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou art plac'd in, ſhall help forward thy Joy and Felicity; and ſome Foundation God is laying in every one of theſe, whereupon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtruct this Happineſs and build that Joy upon it that ſhall never end. O how great are the Priviledges of one that Remembereth God, whom he doth viſit and continually comfort and rejoyce with refreſhig Conſolations! To whom he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth when they come to him with deſire, and doth embrace when they caſt themſelves on him; whom he is teaching and ſhewing the pleaſure that ſtrangers intermeddle not with. But were this all, they would be miſerable, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what they now are. How ſweet are his very Delays, Frowns. and the Chaſtiſements of his Rod! His Eſtrangements, Threatnings, and the ſigns of his Diſpleaſure, dreadful to the Wicked, but ſweet to them that have his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, to make their advantage of them, are in the mean while ſupported under them. I know they are ſad to them, and cauſe great thoughts of Heart; but having the root of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:134641:65"/>matter in them, <hi>Job</hi> 19.28. And being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned by the Word of God, that thus it will ſometime be with his deareſt Children, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected what to do in ſuch times of Mourning; and knowing that they ſhall not be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their ſtrength. Theſe conſiderations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Sufferings and Afflictions to them, and make them far more deſirable to them than the moſt ſplendid Pomp and Proſperity of thoſe that forget God. As all the Mirth and Pleaſures of wicked men, are preparing them for Miſery, and would be dreadful to their thoughts, if they did but ſee what they all contribute to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſhame. So all is contrary in an honeſt and pure hearted Believer; not only the ſmiles, but the angry looks of God are ſweet to his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, not as they are ſigns of his diſpleaſure, but as they help him forward in the hatred of ſin, and mortifie his Affections to the Pleaſures here below. I know the Anger of God is not directly deſirable to any Perſon, but the ſanctified fruits of it are deſirable. And ſome little of it, when ſin (that would otherwiſe undo us) makes it neceſſary, and it is mingled with a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love, and the Soul is diſpoſed by Grace to tremble under it, and to be rid of it upon any terms.</p>
                  <p>Conſider therefore thou that Remembreſt God, Is it not an unvaluable comfort to fore-know, that all thy Trouble and Sorrows ſhall befriend thee, and that the leaneſt paſture thou canſt be put in, ſhall feed thee up to everlaſting Joys; when on the other ſide, thoſe that forget God, though they fare deliciouſly every day, and are gotten into the

Methinks that place ſhould ſound dreadful to one that proſpereth in the World, and doth not remember God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.7. The two verſes that go before it uſhers it in, and that follows after in fearful pomp and ſtate. <hi>O Lord, how great are thy Works! and thy Thoughts very deep. A brutiſh man knoweth not, neither doth a fool underſtand this. When the wicked ſpring as the Graſs, and all the workers of Iniquity do flonriſh; it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever.</hi> And we may ſay as well on the other ſide, that God is as wonderful in his thoughts toward ſuch as are mindful of him, though a Fool underſtand not. That when the humble Believer, in whoſe thoughts God in Chriſt dwelleth uppermoſt, withers as the Graſs, and fades like the green Herb; it is that he may flouriſh for ever. If thou art trod upon thou ſhalt grow the better. Thy neceſſities ſhall cauſe thee to make more haſte, and get nearer to the Fountain that is opened, to the eternal praiſe of Gods Mercy, for ſuch needy ones. All thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries ſhall but the more illuſtrate the Glory of his Compaſſion toward thee, when refuge faileth thee, and none careth for thy Soul. Many a one had liv'd and died in perpetual obſourlty,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:134641:66"/>whoſe names are a rich perſume in the Church of God, thorough their Sufferings and Afflictions, which have made them the more famous, and embalm'd their Memory.</p>
                  <p>When the ways of a Man pleaſe the Lord, he can and will, in one ſenſe or other, make his very Enemies to be his Friends; (1.) Their hatred ſhall be turned into love; or if it do continue ſtill, God ſhall turn their very hatred and enmity to the greater advantage of thoſe that are mindful of him. This made <hi>Paul</hi> to boaſt in his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Neceſſities and Tribulation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. What if thou art poor and neceſſitous; if the Lord remember thee? What if thou haſt no Friends on Earth, if thou haſt one in Heaven? What if thou art deſtitute of Health it ſelf, the greateſt Earthly Bleſſing? if thou art one that remembreſt God, it ſhall turn to thine advantage. If thou haſt God in thy Remembrance thou haſt all; for he will make every ſtate and condition ſerve thy turn. What if thou art a Servant, if God be thy Maſter? If thou haſt nothing to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee unto Men, if thou haſt this Grace I am preſſing to, to recommend thee unto God, thou ſhalt be more a gainer than if thou hadſt had Dominion in the World, and all the Paint and Varniſh that would ſet thee off to the Eye of Men. Thy Temptations, Reproach, Sufferings of every kind, and thy very Proſperity and Wordly Happineſs, which for the moſt part is ſuch a preparative to Deſtruction, ſhall be like the Dew and Sun-ſhine to thee, and make thee more fruitful and ripen thy Graces, if thou art one that haſt God always in thy Remembrance.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:134641:66"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If thou art one that remembreſt God, as I have expreſſed, thou haſt the Key to unlock all the Mercies of God, and to open the rich and moſt rareſt Treaſures of Divine Grace, and to get the very deſire of thy Heart; I mean, thou mayſt come with Faith and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Throne of Mercy, and open thy very Heart to him, who hath an Ear for all thy Requeſts. <hi>The ſecrets of the Lord are with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thy heart.</hi> and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. later clauſe 16. <hi>v. The effectual fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man availeth much.</hi> Now to fear the Lord, to remember him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, are but ſeveral Deſcriptions of a Righteous Man and Believer. Thou canſt not have God in thy Mind and Heart, but thou wilt fear him, love him, delight in him in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, think on him, truſt in him in the way that he hath directed, and then thou art a Believer, and a Righteous Perſon in the Goſpel ſenſe, though not in the ſenſe of the Law, that requires perfect Obedience. It was ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he could do what he would with God by Prayer. If God be promoted in thy Heart, as high as he was in <hi>Luth.</hi> thou ſhalt prevail with him as much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Luth.</hi> did. I know thou haſt no ground from the word to expect that God ſhould ſatisfie thy deſires in temporal things, when they will not conſiſt with the welfare of thy Soul. But every deſire that is honourable to God to grant, and profitable to thy Soul to receive, thou ſhalt have. And when he denies thee what thou doſt expreſs, he will give what thou doſt imply and mean. When he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:134641:67"/>not thy particular Requeſt, he will give thee thy general Requeſt, whatſoever thou askeſt, it's happineſs that thou meaneſt, that's the general intent and meaning; and this he will fulfil, though not always in the ſame method, it may be, that thine own Wiſdom ſuggeſteth; he will give thee money or money worth. Thou ſhalt have thy deſire in kind or value, yea, a frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God will teach thee to pray ſo as thou ſhalt prevail; and the knowledge of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Perfections, which the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God doth imply, will make thee ſo ingenious as to ask nothing that ſhall croſs the Wiſdom, Juſtice, or Holineſs of God, or be the leaſt prejudicial to the merciful deſign of thy Salvation.</p>
                  <p>O what a priviledge is it to have ſuch an open free acceſs to him, that can ſtrangely turn things about when it pleaſeth him, and is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in Counſel and mighty in Working, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 28.29. with a promiſe to be heard; to plead with God and get the Bleſſing for thy Self, for thy Relations, and for the Land of thy Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and by this means to be one of the Props and Pillars of the Nation, of which thou art a Member. This is an Honour indeed, and an unvaluable Mercy, which yet thou ſhalt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, in that degree and meaſure as thou doſt Remember him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To Remember God is the ready way to entail the Bleſſing of Heaven and Earth upon thy Seed and Poſterity. Children ſpeed ordinarily according to their Parents intereſt, or want of intereſt in God. Thoſe that die in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, it's more than probable that they ſpeed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:134641:67"/>according as their Parents, or thoſe that have the neareſt intereſt in them, are in Covenant with God or out of Covenant. And thoſe that live beyond an Infants ſtate, have cauſe to count amongſt the greateſt of their early Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, that they have either one or both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that are true Believers, eſpecially where the Faith of their Parents is gotten up to ſome degree of Eminency. I would not intimate that the Lord doth never ſhew ſpecial love and mercy to the Poſterity of the Wicked, nor that he doth always impart ſaving Grace to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the godly. But I believe it will prove a rare caſe, if one inſtance can be produced, that all the Children of Believers (if they have ſeveral) are finally forſaken of God, and denyed his ſaving Grace; yea, many times they are all remembred. It is the Argument that <hi>Peter</hi> uſeth to perſwade Faith and Repentance to his hearers; in the firſt Sermon which he preached after Chriſts Aſſention, and the Deſcenſion of the Holy Ghoſt, that by this means Parents would bring their Children to participate in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy with themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39, <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For the Promiſe is to you and your Children.</hi> And it hath the moſt general teſtimony of the ſoundeſt Writers, that the Faith of the Parents is the condition of the Childrens right to Baptiſm. The <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of it in the Court of Men; the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of it in the Court of Heaven.

                     </note> But be it how it will, I am
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:134641:68"/>ſure it's a doleful condition to be the Child of wicked Parents, that forget God; and a mercy better than the biggeſt Portion can be left them to be the Seed of Parents that Remember him. Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Fear not, O Jacob, my Servant, for I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my. Bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring,</hi> Eſa. 44.3. And as the ſpecial Promiſe was made to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo even <hi>Iſhmael</hi> fared the better for being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed. And as it is threatned in one of the Prophets, that the Seed of evil doers ſhall never he Renowned; ſo the Poſterity of thoſe that Remember God, are the moſt likely to be Remembred, even in this Life, and to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in their Congregation, Men of Renown, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.2. I do not mean for their worldly Pomp and Splendor, but for their Grace, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Uſefulneſs to the World. To which ſometime, ſuch a meaſure of theſe outward Bleſſings are added; as may make their Grace more reſplendent, and them more ſerviceable to him, that will moſt eminently reward it. If therefore your own Bowels are dear to you, and you deſire that your Poſterity ſhould be bleſſed here, and had in Eternal Remembrance hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; advance God in your Remembrance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This Exerciſe of thy Thoughts and Affections in the Remembrance of God, is thy greateſt Happineſs, as well as thy greateſt intereſt; I mean, it will yield thee the higheſt Pleaſure as well as the higheſt Profit. I know to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that have no competent knowledge of God, and ſuch as are unwonted to theſe thoughts, and have their Affections buried in the World, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:134641:68"/>are loaden with divers Luſts; no work is more unpleaſant, nothing that they will more decline; Light it ſelf is unpleaſant to a ſore and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Eye; but thoſe that are pretty well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the amiable Nature and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, and with ſuch Thoughts and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of him, as will amount to a worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him, would not be untaught this Art for all the Pleaſures which the World can ſupply to them. Theſe are the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, theſe are the moſt comforting, theſe are the moſt ſatisfying Thoughts. Theſe are the moſt illuminating, inſtructing, perfecting Thoughts. Theſe are the Thoughts that beſt improve our preſent Comfort and our future Hopes. From all theſe Heads, I might particularly and diſtinctly ſhew, how the ſincere Remembrance of God doth make way for the greateſt Pleaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> In that it doth, 1. Clear and perfect the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. Purifie and rejoyce the Heart. 3. Revive the Spirit, and actuate it to greater Life, and Life is ſweet. 4. In that it doth quiet and ſatisfie the very Soul. 5. Multiply and improve our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Comforts. 6. And our future Happineſs. All theſe ways and many other, doth this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God contribute to our immediate Pleaſure and Happineſs. That Soul muſt needs abound moſt with Life and Joy, and Pleaſure, that hath moſt frequent acceſs to the Fountain of all Life and Pleaſure, who enjoy themſelves more than they (if other things concur) that are moſt under the power and command of ſuch thoughts? Such as theſe have their Hearts fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently filled with Laughter, and their Tongues
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:134641:69"/>with Rejoycing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2. Hence thoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable ſtrains of <hi>David,</hi> ſo frequent in the <hi>Pſalms I will ſing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will ſing praiſe unto my God, whilſt I have my being. My Meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 104.33, 34. The more bright and glorious the Object is upon which the thoughts do dwell, the more it doth exhilerate and refreſh. In a word, The more God is in thy Remembrance, the more of Content and ſubſtantial Joy thou ſhalt feel in thy Heart. So much for the means by way of conſideration to help forward in this duty.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the means by way of Exerciſe, or the more practical Directions.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are either more poſitive, and ſuch as directly concern the Duty, or elſe <hi>negative,</hi> and ſuch as comprize the hinderances which are to be carefully avoided. And as theſe are firſt in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice ſo they ſhall be firſt in the directions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you would get the pleaſure of theſe Thoughts into your Heart, you muſt not allow your ſelves to live in any known ſin whatſoever. becauſe ſuch ſin is of an oblivious nature, and will extinguiſh the Memory of God. The love and voluntary entertainment of an Enemy and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, will not conſiſt with the Love and Loyalty we owe to God, and which a worthy Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance doth imply. Even Men will queſtion your Love and Friendſhip, and take you for a double dealer, and a falſe hearted diſſembler, if you take an utter Enemy of theirs into your Fellowſhip, and uſe him as your Intimate and Companion. And though it may conſiſt with Friendſhip to fall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:134641:69"/>into the company of one that is an Enemy to your Friend, now and then, when it is not your choice and ſeeking, but ſurprize, or ſome other reaſon, drew you into his company, not any ſpecial love to, or complacency in his Perſon; and you are glad when you have an opportunity to be rid of ſuch a Gueſt; yet you plainly violate ſuch Love and Friendſhip, and are like to loſe all intereſt in your Friend, if you choſe his known Adverſary for your allowed ordinary Companion. And as Love will not conſiſt with ſuch allowance and tolleration of that which is deſtructive of the thing or perſon which you love; ſo much leſs is Loyalty and true Subjection conſiſtent with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and allowed Contradiction to the command of him that hath juſt Rule and Authority over us. A diſcret Maſter will not take him for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant but for a Rebel, that will ordinarily oppoſe and croſs his Juſt and Righteous Command. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will a Parent that doth not dote, take that for an obedient Child that lives in the conſtant violation of a reaſonable Command. And thus it is in all Government here on Earth; and there can be no true Subjection where there is ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Contradiction in any one particular that falls within Bond and Obligation; and is plain Duty. Though the caſe is otherwiſe, if the point be diſputable, and it is no Rebellion, if any one caſe there be, 1. No Command. 2. No right to Command, if a Servant does that to which he believes he hath no contrary Command, or humbly refuſeth that which his Maſter hath no right to command him; his Credit is ſtill good notwithſtanding, in any mans account that judgeth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:134641:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>Righteous Judgment. I know it argues a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Inclination, and ſome degree of Diſloyalty, to queſtion that Command where it's plain and evident; yet where it's certain we have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, it's as certain that we are under no Obligation. But there is a deeper taint of Rebellion in the Heart, and more of enmity to God, that lives in the conſtant breach and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a known Duty; and allows himſelf in the practice of that which he knows God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with. This will not ſuffer him to live in the Remembrance of God, whom he doth daily provoke. If you are therefore ſuch as can live conſtantly in known ſin, you will thruſt all thoughts of God out of your mind, as thoſe which will but create fear and terror in you. But if you have a ſincere (though not a perfect reſpect) to all Gods Commands, you may take Comfort and Pleaſure in the Thoughts and Remembrance of God, though you do fail if you allow it not, but oppoſe your ſin and confeſs it, and pray and ſtrive againſt it; this will conſiſt with the Love of God, which muſt be in the Heart that will worthily Remember him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As you muſt in the <hi>General</hi> reſiſt all known Sin, ſo in <hi>Particular.</hi> Ignorance, or want of the knowledge of God, is an utter Enemy to this Remembrance, and therefore muſt be carefully avoided. Can a Man think that which he hath no knowledge of, and love where he ſees no Beauty? and obey he knows not whom? nor why? He that knows not the Holy Nature of God, and what a Perfection and Happineſs it is to be like him; yea, what an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:134641:70"/>there lies upon every man to be like him, if he will be happy, muſt make haſte and get a cure for ſuch Ignorance, or elſe he can never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty we are upon. If you know not that you are indebted to God for all that you have; that he gave you your Being and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and expects Obedience, and will judge you according to your preſent Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and that he doth ſpy out the thoughts of the Heart, and knows all your Imaginations. If you know not what bowels of Compaſſion are in him, and how much he taketh pleaſure in your welfare, and what courſe he hath taken to bring it to paſs. If you know not what Chriſt hath ſuffered for Sin and Sinners, that God might pardon it, without any Diſhonour to his Juſtice and Holineſs, if the Sinner do repent and beg mercy, you can never Remember God aright, and therefore Ignorance is fearfully threatned in Scripture, as the Mother of all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs. And the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> complains of this ſin in the Jews, and pronounces a heavy Sentence on them for it, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 27.11: <hi>It is a People of no underſtanding</hi> (ſaith he) what then? <hi>therefore he that made them will not have mercy, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> If you love your ſelves, and have any compaſſion for your own Souls, or do believe a Life to come, take heed of this ſin, for without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Soul cannot be good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. There are ſo many and excellent Books that are fitted to the cure of this Diſtemper, that will ſhame this ſin one day, and leave it without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. The truths that are neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:134641:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>are ſo few and ſo plain, and ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the very light of Reaſon, and are preſſed ſo much in the writings of ſo many, that he or ſhe that can but read, cannot miſs inſtruction, yea, they that cannot read) though their caſe be ſad) yet they cannot want inſtruction if they will go for it, to almoſt every Church about them, or to their knowing Neighbours, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be inſtructed. It's one of theſe two or both that undoes all the World, uncatechiſed Head and an unmortified Heart. He that hath an honeſt Heart and a willing Mind, cannot want the knowledge that is neceſſary to Salvation; and wo to them that want this knowledge, for the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſhortly be revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance on all that <hi>know not God.</hi> Shun Ignorance therefore, for he that knows not God cannot Remember him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Flee Inconſideracy, for next to Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance this is the great impediment to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and your own Happineſs: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God given thee a Faculty to conſider, and beſtowed Reaſon on thee? Wherefore hath he ſet his Word and Works before thee? Doth he not mean to draw forth thy thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that thou mayſt conſider and reap the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and give God the Glory? The moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weighty truth will do no good, and never affect thy Heart unleſs they be conſidered.

Though you believe that the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all that forget God; and that all that die in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency ſhall be ſentenced to the Eternal Flames; yet if you ſhut theſe thoughts out of your minds and will not conſider them, what wonder if you live as if there were no ſuch things. What though you believe that the hour is coming in which all that are in the Grave ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God and come forth, they that have done good to the Reſurrection of Life, <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. yet if you conſider not what God hath prepared for them that love him, no wonder if you be weary and faint in the way. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration openeth the Eye and ſoftneth the Heart, and maketh you feel the force and power of truth. If you ſhut your Eyes by inconſideration, the moſt taking Objects will never move you, and the moſt fearful ſight will never fright you. Though it is impoſſible to perſwade a Man whoſe Eyes are open to run into the Fire or Water, or throw himſelf down a Precipice, yet going on and ſhuts his Eyes, will not long eſcape one
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:134641:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>miſchief or another; you will go with the Ox to the ſlaughter, and with the Fool to the correction of the Stocks, if you <hi>conſider</hi> not that it is for your Life. O how many are now roaring in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Fire, that would never have come there if they had but conſidered! O how many forget God and their own Souls day after day, that would not, that could not do ſo if they did but ſeriouſly conſider. What madneſs hath filled the Heart of Man that he ſhould be backward to nothing more than to conſider whilſt it may do him good, and when every thought will cut his Heart he will follow the work cloſe and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but reflect upon and bewail his miſery. As conſideration if it be timely followed and wiſely managed, is the beſt and uſual inſtrument on mans part, to bring a fooliſh, careleſs, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinner to his wits again. So Conſideration when it is too late, is the greateſt inſtrument to put him quite out of his Wits, and to fill his Heart with raging down-right madneſs for ever. You will not be perſwaded to conſider now what you are doing, and whither you are going, and why God hath made you, and given you life and time; but mark what a Prophet tells you, that cannot be deceived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

And the more there is of likeneſs, the more there will be of Love and Remembrance. A hard and unmerciful Heart is ſo unlike to God, that it will ſtrive to forget him, leſt the tender Boweis of God ſhould upbraid his cruel and unrelenting Heart. It's a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:134641:74"/>diſpoſition highly pleaſing to God, and a bleſſed imitation of him, to comport with thoſe that lie under any diſtreſs or miſery, eſpecially thoſe that are ready to faint and ſink under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; and it's Juſtice as well as Mercy ſo to do. Is it not juſt that thou ſhouldſt caſt an Eye of compaſſion and pity upon thoſe on whom the Hand of God is fallen heavy, either in Soul or Body? eſpecially when thou art as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious as they, and God hath ſpared you on purpoſe, and ſet their miſeries before you to move your Bowels? <hi>Shouldſt thou not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on thy fellow Servant, as God hath ſhewed pity unto thee,</hi> Mat. 18.33.

                  <p>And as the miſerable ſtate and condition of Mens Souls, doth moſt eminently beſpeak this Affection, ſo it's Cruelty to overlook their other Miſeries, and not to take them into our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. 1. To get our Hearts affected, that we may truly pity them. 2. And earneſtly pray for them. And 3. Contribute what other help we are able, to make them as happy as our ſelves. There is a ſelfiſhneſs too natural to every one of us, that will not let us hear on this Ear, and therefore we are ſo carleſs in this publick Calamity, what others ſuffer ſo we
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:134641:74"/>are free. How ſenſeleſs are we under ſuch a hand as is fallen upon many parts of this Nation? And therefore we are ſo unthankful for our Health and Preſervation, when God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Lives of ſo many of our Brethren from them? What a fearful, woful Scourge, do the City feel and heavily groan under? How do the Inhabitants of that one proud and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious City, reply to one another in Sighs and Groans, and bitter Out cries and Lamentations, where whole Families are ſmitten and blaſted, and Children and Parents pledge one another in Tears, and drink the Wine of Aſtoniſhment; where deareſt Friends are made the Executors of the Calamities of their departed Friends; and it's taken and accounted for a mercy to die firſt, leſt the miſerable Calamities of Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and their ſucceſſive departure, ſhould be more than one ſingle Death. <hi>Their Eyes affect their Heart,</hi> Lam. 3.51.

Alas! alas! they have the dreadful ſound and noiſe of this Judgment in their Ears, and ſee Death continually before their Eyes; but we hear but at a diſtance, and therefore are not ſtricken with the terror thereof. The report of this Murdering-piece that God hath ſhot off in many places of this Nation, is faint and dead before it comes to our ſenſe. But the leſs we ſee this Miſery and hear theſe Cries, the more we ſhould ſupply this merciful defect

               <p>I come now to the <hi>Second Obſervation, (viz.) That Conſideration is one of the principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on our part, to bring us to the Remembrance of God at firſt, and to prevent forgetfulneſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; or to recover us out of that degree of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, into which we may poſſibly fall. Two Suppoſitions.</hi> 1. Here it is ſuppoſed, 1. That we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re all born into the World in a ſtate of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs; and that Naturally God is not minded by us; he is not in all our thoughts. (1.) By a uſually Hebraiſm in never a one of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:134641:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>them, ſo worthily regarded as he ought, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. Oblivion goes before Remembrance in every Child of <hi>Adam.</hi> I know Forgetfulneſs doth ſuppoſe that we either had or ſhould have had, the habit of which this is the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: We cannot be ſaid in any propriety of Speech, to forget that which we never did, or never ought to have Remembred. As a thing can never be ſaid to be blind which never ſaw nor ought to have ſeen: But it is our miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unhappy caſe and condition, that we were made to Remember God, and to give him the higheſt of our Praiſes, and had a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fit for ſo high and noble Service, and yet are born into the World in a groſs ignorance of God, with a Nature that continually diſpoſeth us to forget him, and to entertain the moſt contemptible Vanities into our Thoughts and Affections before him. This is the Diſeaſe that Chriſt came to Cure, with the greateſt pity and compaſſion to Mankind; which it is the inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of his Word and Croſs and Spirit, and all his Ordinances to remove; and which is cured in a ſincere and prevailing meaſure, in all that ſhall ſee his Face to their comfort hereafter. And although Infants are not actually guilty of this ſin (as neither they are of any other ſin) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not come to the uſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore cannot perform any act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly vertuous or ſinful, yet they have an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Diſpoſition, a Seed in them that will bring forth this curſed Fruit, when they are capable: But for thoſe that have paſs'd an Infants ſtate, and are grown up to the uſe of Reaſon, there's
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:134641:76"/>nothing that they remember and think on leſs than God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's here ſuppoſed, that after any are recovered by Chriſt, and awakened by his Word and Spirit to a due Remembrance of God, they may fall back into ſuch a degree of Forgetfulneſs again, as that they may queſtion whether ever they had a heart truly mindful of him; though I believe they ſhall never totally and finally fall into Forgetfulneſs, nor be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of Chriſt, if they be in the number of the Elect. And therefore, though Chriſt commends the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> for her Faith and Patience, yet he is ſaid to have ſomewhat againſt her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had left her Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. And ſhe is warned to remember whence ſhe is fallen, and to repent and do her firſt works, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Theſe two particulars are evidently ſuppoſed in this laſt Propoſition, which I am now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute; and that Conſideration of God, his Word and Works, is a neceſſary Remedy on our part, to cure our hereditary Forgetfulneſs, and bring us to the Remembrance I have been pleading for, and to recover us after any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that for theſe Reaſons,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe a Man can never come to the Remembrance of God till his Heart be ſincerely affected with thoſe truths that ſuch a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance doth pre-ſuppoſe; but this can never be done without conſideration. There's nothing that's abſent or Spiritual, that can affect the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:134641:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heart, and get that Fort, unleſs it be led in by Conſideration, that's the Eye of the Soul; and 'tis the Eye only that can affect the Heart. There's nothing that can affect the Body, or move the Bodily Paſſions, that is not firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by ſome Bodily Senſe, that is, not ſeen or heard, or perceived, by ſome other ſenſe. Now Conſideration ſupplies that to the Soul, which the five Senſes do to the Body; it's the Eye, Ear and Taſter of the Soul, whereby it diſcerns what is good or evil to it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Soul doth either embrace or abhor; yea, it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt diſcover not only good and evil, but the degree in which any thing is good or evil, before the Soul can be ſuitably affected therewith, which can never be done with any conſideration. If this Eye be ſhut, ſet the greateſt Danger before a Man and he will not fear; ſet the greateſt Delights before him and he will not be moved to deſire them. What's the reaſon that a wicked Man goes on in ſin and will not forſake it, when you diſplay Hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes, but becauſe he conſiders it not? It appears to him not to be ſo terrible, becauſe this Eye is ſhut. If you run a Sword at a Man whoſe Eyes are ſhut, and ſees it not, he will not endeavour to avoid the thruſt; but he that hath his Eyes open, and ſees what's coming towards him, will quickly ſtart back and decline that inſtrument of Death. A careleſs Man that never conſidered well what a fearful thing it is to fall into the Hands of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> how intolerable his Diſpleaſure is when it ſhall break forth in good earneſt, and burn like a conſuming
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:134641:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>fire, will venture on it for a little deluding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. A Man that conſiders not the worth of his Soul will neglect it, and not think it worth ſo many Prayers and Tears, and ſuch diligence as muſt be uſed to procure the Salvation thereof; for till his Heart be touched with a lively feeling and ſenſe of theſe truths, he will not neglect them and live after the Fleſh; and if he doth not weigh and conſider them, his Heart will never be made to feel them. What's the reaſon that Men hug and embrace a little dirt and filth, and ſuffer their Affections to cleave ſo faſt to their Carnal Contentments? It can be reſolved into nothing better than that they do not conſider what Sin and Folly they are guilty of, and what an impediment they are, being embraced to the true content and happineſs of their Souls, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would not, nor could not, be ſo mad as embrace the preſent World and to prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World to come. Well then, is it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that muſt bring a Man to a worthy Remembrance of God, becauſe it opens the Eye and affects the Heart, and puts an edge upon every Truth that doth bias and diſpoſe the Soul to this Remembrance, that it's felt and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſome ſincere meaſure of ſubmiſſion. The Soul is ſuch a Subject, that cannot be wrought upon without its own conſent, and that's not eaſily gained to any thing that's of a reforming ſaving tendency, unleſs frequent and ſerious Conſideration make way. The Soul will never conſent to any purpoſe, that the Fleſh ſhould be afflicted and humbled, that it's Affections and Luſts ſhould be mortified and ſubdued, till
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:134641:77"/>Conſideration ſhew the neceſſity thereof, and the Death that will follow, if this Death do not go before. There are ſome truths that are prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this Remembrance, which though they are eaſie to be known, yet they will never be drunk in or digeſted, till Conſideration ſhew their excellency and plead their great neceſſity and importance to us, and give no reſt till it hath enforced conſent and reſolution to obey. Theſe Truths are of two ſorts,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Some are</hi> Phyſick <hi>and meerly purgative.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Others are</hi> Cordial, <hi>and ſuch as are reſtorative and comforting.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And although there is reluctancy enough in the diſtempered Soul of Man to both theſe, yet he nauſeats theſe of the firſt rank moſt, and hath the greateſt enmity to them. He doth not reliſh the ſecond ſort, but he perfectly hates the firſt ſort; the reaſon is, becauſe theſe Truths which I call Medicinal, work directly upon the diſturbing Humour and filthy Matter, that muſt be evacuated and eaſt out, before we can find any Guſt or Savour in thoſe other Truths that are Nutritive and Cordial. What averſneſs is there in the corrupt Nature of Man, to admit thoſe Truths into the Heart, that croſs either, 1. The Intereſt, or, 2. The Inclination of the Fleſh, and that ſtrike all the Heart and Root of the Old Man; and that teach Self-denial, that is, the mortification of inward Luſts, and the contempt of all outward Objects, ſo far as they feed and nouriſh them? And will a Man ever pull out
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:134641:78"/>his right Eye, and cut off his right Hand (for his Pride and his Paſſion, and his Intemperance, and his Petulary and Laſciviouſneſs, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Luſt to which his Nature prompts him, are as dear to him as his moſt beloved Members) and will a Man ever digeſt ſuch truths as theſe, or take them into any place of ſtrength, that are ſuch bloody enemies to his raging prevailing Luſts; and arm and mortifie them againſt ſo dear and near a part of him? This can never be done till Conſideration make it appear, that the Man is undone for ever, and had better he had never been born, be he never ſo rich and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the World, in whom there is any reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Luſt or Corruption; till frequent thoughts convince him thoroughly, that he that ſaveth ſuch a Life as this ſhall loſe it, and a better. But on the other ſide, he that kills his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and ſuffereth no ſin to prevail, but mortifieth every one of theſe Members, that make up the Body and the Life of the Old Man; he that loſeth ſuch a Life as this ſhall find it, and prove an unſpeakable gainer, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.35.</p>
               <p>Let me inſtance more particularly in ſome truths, that muſt go before a worthy Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God, which can never get into the Heart and work to any purpoſe, <hi>till they be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Conſideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It's an eaſie Truth, and very obvious to Man's underſtanding, <hi>That God is the chief Good,</hi> and our true happineſs conſiſteth in his Love and Goodneſs. This is the maſter Principle and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Religion, and inſpires all practical Truths, and the duty depends upon them with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:134641:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>Breath and Life; and were it well thought upon, it would make a mighty change and alteration in the World; you may ſee by what it does upon ſome that do conſider it, what it would do upon others if they were not inconſiderate. In that proportion that Men conſider this Truth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, they will ſtudy to pleaſe God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him in all his <hi>imitable Perfections;</hi> and their Love and Hatred will imitate his: They will follow after Peace and Holineſs, without which daily Conſideration aſſures them they can never ſee God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. And they will have no Fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of Darkneſs, becauſe God hateth them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. None in <hi>ſenſu morali, though not in ſenſu phyſico. Where that that falls ſhort of a ruling maſtering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Morality, is ſaid not to be.</hi> And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture frequently ſpeaks after the ſame rate. But he that lives after the Fleſh, and minds earthly things, and bleſſeth himſelf in all worldly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cannot conſider the fore-mentioned Truth, and therefore is guilty of this Folly becauſe he doth not conſider.</p>
               <p>It's another weighty truth, <hi>That we are fallen from God and Happineſs, into a ſtate of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,</hi> and ſhall never know what true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs means till we return. We were made after his Likeneſs at the firſt, and whilſt we kept the ſtamp of his Image on us, were happy in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Love; and all Creatures were ready at our beck and ſervice; and Sorrow and Miſery ſtood afar off and came not near us; but having now provoked God and loſt his Image, we are now unſpeakably miſerable, and in the path-way
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:134641:79"/>to Eternal Miſery. And what's the reaſon that there are ſo few that are affected at the Heart with their condition, that loath themſelves, that cry out of this bondage, and would be ſet at liberty and reſtored into favour again, but becauſe there are but few that conſider it. The reſt of their minds are taken up with other things, and with worldly vanities; and ſuch diſturbing thoughts as theſe are at the firſt, are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter, which if they be not frequent and ſerious till the Soul hath got a full ſight of the evil of Gods diſpleaſure, and ſin that hath provoked it, and the neceſſity and bleſſedneſs of his Favour. Theſe Truths, though they ſhould be taken in or aſſented to, they will lie crude and raw upon the Stomach, and never digeſt into good nouriſhment, and be diſtributed into Life and Practice. Conſideration muſt awaken the Soul out of its Stupidity and Inſenſibleneſs, which is Natural to all, or elſe it will ſleep into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third plain, but neceſſary and important Truth is, That we are undone for ever unleſs we feel our Sin and Miſery ſo as to confeſs it with inward ſhame, and be humbled under it, into that degree of Brokenneſs and Contrition; that Salvation by Chriſt is the moſt welcome news that ever we heard or can hear, inſomuch that we embrace him with the higheſt love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and do heartily conſent to be governed by him, till he hath ſubdued our Corruptions, ſanctified us by his Spirit, and made us meet for love and favour of God again. But none can ever feel the worth and neceſſity of Chriſt and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:134641:79"/>renewing Grace, who have not ſet this matter by Conſideration, frequently before your Eyes. It's true of the Intellectual as well as the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Eye, out of ſight out of mind; what we ſee not by Conſideration, we ſhall never mind nor care for. You will ſlight the greateſt Truths, and lie ſtill in any ſtate in the World, though never ſo uneaſie, rather than part with ſin and come to Chriſt, if you do not conſider that your ſin will be bitterneſs in the end, and Chriſt will make amends for all that do or ſuffer for him. There be many other Truths in which I might inſtance, What's the reaſon that matters of ſuch a conſequence and weight, and ſo certain and out of doubt as Death and the Reſurrection, and the Glory of Heaven, and the Torments of Hell, ſhould work no more, and make Men ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about them? Why do Men die before they were aware, and in ſuch a careleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared ſtate? Why do they run upon the vengeance of Eternal Fire, and take no care to get the Crown that fadeth not away? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14. They are inconſiderate, and will not ſuffer their Hearts to muſe on theſe things. O if theſe things were conſidered to any purpoſe, your worldly buſineſs, which you now pretend ſo much againſt theſe things, would ſeem light and trivial, and meer Childs-play, in compariſon or that work which is of Ten thouſand times higher concernment. You would not on the one h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd neglect the opportunities of your Souls, and of getting Grace and Peace with God, thorough our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and making your felt for ever. If theſe thoughts did but dwell in your
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:134641:80"/>Minds, and if Conſideration did but open your Eye, and ſhew you the worth and excellency, the force and neceſſity, of theſe big and moſt concerning Truths. Neither would you on the other hand, attend the means of Grace with ſuch ſleepy, inattentive wandring Hearts. Is not that Man a ſot indeed, that can ſleep upon a Scaffold when he is going to Execution? Is not that Man a careleſs, ſtupid wretch indeed, that will give no attention or heed what the Judge ſays when he is paſſing Sentence either of Life or Death upon him? And yet it is the caſe of many a ſinner, that's careleſs and inconſiderate, when he is dying and going into another World; and therefore he makes none, or but fooliſh preparation. Conſideration, if it were followed, would bring home theſe Truths, and give them a power to pierce and become ſenſible, and make the Man that doth conſider them to live anſwerably to them. Phyſick worketh not in the Preſcription or Doctors Bill, no nor in the Apothecaries Shop, where it is prepared, till it be taken and let down into the Stomach, or ſome way taken into the Body; for it nouriſheth not in the Diſh or on the Table, no nor though it be taken into the Mouth, if it be not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Stomach and there concocted. Neither will the greateſt Truths cure the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of a ſinful and perverted Heart, or nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh up the Soul to any Spiritual Life and vigour in the Book; nor in the Mouth of the Teacher, nor yet if they be taken into the Brain, till Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation bring them to the Heart, and the Soul by Conſideration look frequently upon the worth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:134641:80"/>and weight of them, and enforce Subjection and Obedience thereto. For want of this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe few, plain and important Truths it is, that Men forget God, and never attain to a due Remembrance of him; and for want of this they relapſe and loſe their firſt Love and Memory of him. And therefore Conſideration is the beſt way to beget this Remembrance at firſt, and to reſtore it afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such Conſideration is very ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and powerful, to bring a Man at firſt to Remember God, or to recover his Thoughts and Affections again after a decay and relapſe; becauſe in both theſe caſes the Word of God calls to Conſideration, and inſiſts perpetually upon this Duty. When the Prophets of God are ſent to call Men to their firſt or after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they uſually deliver their Meſſage in terms that expreſs or imply Conſideration. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the return of the Jews from the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> Captivity, from the which the Lord had brought them by ſuch a mighty hand, they forgat the Lord, and grew preſently careleſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of his Houſe and Worſhip; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Haggai</hi> is ſent, 1. To cenſure and reprove the ſin; and 2. To preſcribe the Remedy and Means to cure their ſin and bring them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Their ſin is taxed pretty ſharply, and is charged on them by a cutting Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled Houſes, and Gods Houſe lie waſte?</hi> and conſequently his Service neglected, which was then ſo much confined to the Temple. In the next verſe he propoſeth the Remedy,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:134641:81"/>
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Now therefure, thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, conſider your ways.</hi> Nay to ſhew the vertue and neceſſity of it, he urgeth it the ſecond time <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, conſider your ways.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> implieth the excellency of this Remedy, in that he doth lay the blame of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Rebellion and Ingratitude upon the want of this. They were grown to a ſtrange paſs of monſtrous Wickedneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, which the Prophet knew not how to expreſs, and therefore calls upon Heaven and Earth to take notice, that God had nouriſhed and brought up Children, and yet they rebelled againſt him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.2. and fetcheth his proof from the Brutes and irrational Creatures, to convince them of their ſin. The Oxe knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſters Crib, (1.) ſaith <hi>Vatablus</hi> the Maſter of his Crib. But <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth not know; and what's the reaſon of ſuch ſhameful miſcarriage? <hi>My People doth not conſider.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> intimateth, that Death and Judgment, which are the moſt powerful means to awaken Men to Repentance; and the Remembrance of God will do no good without Conſideration; but if he could bring them to this Duty, to conſider of theſe things, he did not doubt their Welfare and Happineſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. <hi>O that my People were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end.</hi> This act of Conſideration applied to this Object, is a moſt excellent means to bring Men to Wiſdom and Underſtanding, which are inſolent with an Impenitency and Forgetfulneſs of God. And without this leading act of the Soul. there can
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:134641:81"/>be no beſeeming Apprehenſions of him, nor Service rightly performed to him. And where there is leaſt of this, there is moſt of Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſlightneſs in his Worſhip, and moſt of Irreligion and Athieſm in the Life. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> when he is Exhorting the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to a due Remembrance of God and Veneration of him, he gives them this Advice, <hi>Know therefore this day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in thine Heart, that the Lord he is God, in Heaven above, and upon the Earth beneath; and there is none elſe,</hi> Deut. 4.39. When Men flee off from this, and will not ſet themſelves to conſider and underſtand, neither <hi>Correction</hi> nor <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> nor <hi>Mercies</hi> will ſucceed; but all will loſe their deſigned end, and leave a Man under Impenitency and Forgetfulneſs. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> adviſeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus to conſider, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt not conſider it in thine Heart, that as a Man chaſteneth his Son, ſo the Lord thy God chaſteneth thee.</hi> The ſame word in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> ſignifieth to <hi>Conſider and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one ſo much dependeth upon the other.</p>
               <p>And as, 1 Correction will not proſper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, ſo neither will,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Inſtruction, which is another means to to produce this worthy Remembrance of God. Hence it is that the Apoſtle urgeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he had taught them, or elſe the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:134641:82"/>Inſtructions he had given them were like to be as Water ſpilt upon the ground, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.7. It's the Lord that giveth underſtanding, but it is to ſuch as conſider, and no other. And as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the former will ſpeed without the frequent repeated act of Conſideration; not Correction, not Inſtruction, ſo neither,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Will his Favour and Mercies, properly ſo called (for I know both the former may be called Mercies and Favours in a larger ſenſe) Theſe, I ſay, that are Mercies to preſent ſenſe and feeling, will do no good, or elſe a great deal of hurt without Conſideration; God will loſe our acknowledgment of them, and we the bleſſed comfortable fruits of them. What the Prophet ſaith of a wicked Man, I may well ſay of an Inconſiderate Man, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.10. <hi>Let Favour be ſhewed to ſuch a one, yet will he not remember whence it is, nor learn Righteouſneſs.</hi> And therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> preſſeth this Duty as the fitteſt to bring the ſtupid <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the Remembrance of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the terms, Fear and Service; <hi>Only fear the Lord and ſerve him in truth, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how great things he hath done for you,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.24. And as Conſideration is the likelieſt means to bring a Man home to the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God in Chriſt at firſt, and to improve <hi>Correction, Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> to the end; ſo it is as ſucceſsful to recover a Man after a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:134641:82"/>Relapſe into Forgetfulneſs. To this Remedy <hi>David</hi> was beholding (though never a whit the leſs to God, who put him upon the uſe of it) <hi>I thought on my wars,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and turned my Feet unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.59. And <hi>Peter</hi> was thus recovered after his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Forgetting of Chriſt and Denial of him; and <hi>Peter</hi> remembred, (1.) Thought upon and conſidered the words which Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>Before the Cock crow thou ſhalt deny me thrice; and he went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Mat. 26.75. And <hi>Elihu</hi> propoſeth this to <hi>Job</hi> as a proper Remedy to abaſe and humble him that ſo much inſiſted upon his own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and remembred not his infinite diſtance from God, as he ſhould have done, and therefore brought him to the Bar of his own perverted Judgment. <hi>Hearken unto this, O Job, ſtand ſtill and conſider the wondrous works of God,</hi> Job 37.14. And this courſe cured him. <hi>I have heard of thee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with the hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eyes ſeeth thee. Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> Job 42.5, 6. He did before ſtretch his own Righteouſneſs ſo far, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Soveraignty of God, as if he had done unjuſtly or cruelly in afflicting one ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as he was: But when he had more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſidered the Majeſty and Glory of God, and his wonderful Power, according to the ſcheme and draught that <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſet before him. Then the Bladder was prick'd, and he was humbled in his own thoughts, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:134641:83"/>ſaw that for his very Integrity, which he held ſo faſt and juſtified ſo much, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to God for.</p>
               <p>And as Conſideration is a means to bring the Heart to God at firſt, and to recover the Heart to him, when it begins to depart by unbelief, ſo it is an excellent help to increaſe and ſtrengthen this Remembrance, to ſtrain it to a higher peg, and make it more intenſe and vigorous. <hi>My Heart was hot within me, while I was muſing the Fire burned, then ſpake I with my Tongue, Pſal.</hi> 39.3. The Conſideration of Gods immutable Goodneſs and everlaſting Favour, and the brevity and vanity of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, ſtirr'd the Fire and awakened his Heart to a more ſavoury Remembrance of God; when he had conſidered how many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces Riches did lie open to, and what a blaſt Mans Life is, he ſubjoyns: <hi>And now, O Lord, what wait I for, my hope is even in thee,</hi> Pſal. 39.7. And while the thoughts of Believers are inditing good matters, their Tongue is as the Pen of a ready Writer; quick to expreſs the praiſes of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. And <hi>Davids</hi> deſires after God grew more ſtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, when he thinks on the Pleaſure and Priviledge of Communion with God, from which he was baniſhed in the Wilderneſs. <hi>When I think on or remember theſe things, I pour out my Soul in me, for I had gone with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, with the voice nf Joy and Praiſe.</hi> He means to the publick and ſolemn Worſhip of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:134641:83"/>God. And now the Conſideration of his want of theſe Priviledges cut this gaſh in his Heart, and made this gaping of his deſires after God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know there are other means to be uſed beſides Conſideration; but this is, 1. The leading act to bring on all the other that have any ſubſerviency to this Remembrance of God. And, 2. The act that inſpires Life and Soul into all other means, whither they be ſuch as <hi>are near to the end</hi> (ſuch as are near Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Mortification, Faith, and all internal Grace, Holineſs) or <hi>ſuch as are more remote from the end;</hi> As Reading, Hearing, Prayer, Holy Conference, whoſe ſucceſs doth uſually depend upon Conſideration; and as it is the leading act. 3. So it is the act in which moſt are defective, and for want of which ſo many do miſcarry and loſe themſelves for ever, and therefore I call it a principle means to beget and cheriſh the Remembrance of God, as I have proved.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the Reaſons.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Application.</p>

                     <hi>FIrſt,</hi> If Conſideration be a means ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Remembrance of God, then here's ſad tidings to the <hi>Inconſiderate.</hi> Such Men muſt needs Forget God, unleſs he were to be ſeen with Corporal Eyes, and his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfections did lie open unto ſenſe. But alas! what a poor ſuperficial Beauty can that diſcover; it can pierce no farther than the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of a bodily Object, and the external Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; it's a meer ſtranger to the inward make and compoſition of ſuch groſs beings as theſe are, and diſcerns not that which is moſt eſſential to them. Much leſs can ſenſe diſcern the Nature of Spirits, and find out the infinite depths of the Divine Nature, and ſearch out the Dimenſions of his Glory. It's uſually ſuch perſons as theſe that make uſe of no other fool than ſenſe to build themſelves up in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that have ſo much Atheiſm in their thoughts. But it's another Eye that muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the Being and Perfections of God, and make known to us both his Immenſity and Eternity, whereby all his other Attributes and Perfections become bottomleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:134641:84"/>
                  <p>This Eye is two fold, according to the double light that is afforded to us for diſcovery. The Eye of, 1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 2. <hi>Faith.</hi> According to the double light of, 1. <hi>Nature,</hi> 2. <hi>Scripture,</hi> which doth diſcover the Object to theſe two Eyes.</p>
                  <p>There are but three ways by which we can come to gain any knowledge of God, or any other thing, either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By ſenſe; ſo we come to know that the Snow is white, or that Graſs is green. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of Deduction or Inference, or Ratiocination; ſo we come to know the Sun is up, though we ſee it not, becauſe we ſee it is day. Our quick underſtanding doth fetch and conclude the one from the other, becauſe the Sun and the Day are neceſſarily connected together.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We come to the knowledge of ſome things upon the meer credit and report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thus we come to know that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> though we never ſaw them, or any matters that are related to us; and we have no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe than what is grounded upon the teſtimony of others. The firſt Knowledge we call Senſe, the ſecond Reaſon, the third Faith.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:134641:85"/>
                  <p>Now Faith is two-fold, for either it is grounded upon the credit of Man or God. The firſt is fallible, becauſe there is no Man but may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or be deceived, and is defective both in Knowledge and Goodneſs. The one makes it poſſible for him to deceive, the other to be deceived. And from hence it is that his Credit is crack'd, and his Teſtimony, where it is not accompanied with ſome other evidence inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. But a Divine Teſtimony (where we are ſure of it) is infallible; for it's Blaſphemy to imagine that God is ſo weak as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or ſo bad as to deceive. Hence it is that whatſoever we have ſuch a Teſtimony for, we may be as certain of, as if we ſaw it with our Eyes, or had the greateſt evidence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. Such a Faith as this and Reaſon, are the two Eyes by which we do diſcover what it is to be known of God in his Word and Works.</p>
                  <p>But Conſideration is that which fixeth both theſe Eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and helps them to underſtand more diſtinctly, and be affected with the glorious Perfections of God, as they are diſcovered in the Scripture, or may be gathered from the works of Creation and Providence. A caſt of either of theſe Eyes, of Faith or Reaſon, but eſpecially the firſt, may diſcover God to the Soul in ſome degree, enough to leave it without excuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, if it ſeek no further; but it's Conſideration only that can give us ſuch a ſight of the Object, as ſhall command the higheſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:134641:85"/>eſteem and love of him, which muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and make way for a worthy Remembrance of him. Though we ſhould ſuppoſe a Perſon (that's guilty of Inconſideration, and doth not meditate on God, his Word and Works, in any degree ſuited to the Object) to have ſo much Faith and Reaſon as to profeſs Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to become a formal Chriſtian, yet he will never be a Saint and Chriſtian at the Heart and Root, till his Reaſon and Faith be radicated and confirmed by Conſideration. Neither is it any Conſideration, the want whereof doth make a Man ſo miſerable. Wicked Men ſpend thoughts enough upon their Corn and Wine, and Oyl, upon their Profits and Pleaſures, and tickle themſelves with ſuch Meditations, and fix their Eye too much upon worldly Glory, and pre-injoy their happineſs before it comes, and comfort themſelves by an after Remembrance of it. I would they were in theſe things more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, or at leaſt conſider them after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, what reference they have to the Life to come, to the pleaſing of God and ſaving of their Souls, or conſider inwhat a bitterneſs their ſweeteſt pleaſures will conclude, or think on them according to the deſcription that God hath given of them in his Word. I know Conſideration, if it be rational, ſerious and impartial, will digrace and ſhame the beſt of their ſenſual, brutiſh Pleaſures; and the moſt ſober Comforts here on Earth, that are joyned with the neglect of God and Mens Souls.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:134641:86"/>And therefore ſuch Thoughts as tie Mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections faſter to theſe things, are not worthy the name of Conſideration; beſides, ſuch thoughts as theſe ſtand in the greateſt enmity to that Conſideration, which the Text calls to, and the neglect whereof is ſo pernicious and deſtructive. It's impoſſible for thoſe that employ their thoughts with eagerneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light upon earthly things, to command them to any exerciſe that deſerves to be called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. And if they be forced at any time to think on theſe matters that are out of ſight, and to meditate on God and the Life to come, and the ſlipperineſs of preſent things, it will be with ſo much wearineſs, confuſion and partiality, that will quite intercept the fruit and comfort thereof. I know the thoughts of the beſt move heavily and diſorderly to this work, partly thorough want of matter and skill to uſe it to their further edification; and partly thorough want of uſe and more frequent exerciſe in this kind, as alſo becauſe they are ſtill earthly in part, as well as others, but yet they do frequently conſider theſe things, and are affected with them, and provoked hereby to labour after them, more than any thing that the World can propoſe; but woe be to thoſe that conſider not theſe things till they are thus affected and reſolved. 'Tis not ſome curſory thoughts that will affect a Man with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God and his Ways, and the love of Chriſt, ſo as to turn the courſe and bent of his Life towards them, and to fix his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:134641:86"/>to cleave faſt to them, whatſoever difficulty or diſcouragement he meet with; and yet if this be not done, profeſs what thou wilt, thou art not a true Chriſtian; yea, if thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate in any notorious degree, thou art undoubtedly a perfect enemy to the Croſs of Chriſt, and a perſecutor of his Servants; <hi>David</hi> gives no better deſcription of ſuch Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The wicked through the Pride of his Countenance will not ſeek after God, God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> And then mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, 1. He is an enemy to the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>His ways are always grievous, thy Judgments are far above out of his ſight. His Mouth is full of curſing and deceit, and fraud; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his tongue is miſchief and vanity.</hi> And, 2. He is alſo a Perſecutor of his Servants. <hi>He ſitteth in the lurking places of the Villages, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places doth he murther the innocent, ver.</hi> 8. I dare confidently ſay, that an Inconſiderate Man cannot remember God; nor believe in Chriſt, to ſay the beſt that can be ſaid of him. But he may do worſe than be a baſe unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and run into all Exceſs, Riot and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, when a fair opportunity is offered, if Conſideration do not hold the Bridle and and keep him in.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Inconſideracy leads Men to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and meer Formality in the ſervice of God. There's none ſo over ſlight and ſuperficious in the Service of God, as thoſe that conſiders not with whom they have to do. Cuſtom and Education, and the common Example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with whom we live; and the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Chriſtianity hath got among us, may draw us to the external Worſhip of God; and compoſe the Body to do ſome ſeeming ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to our Redeemer, both in Publick and Private; but it's the Conſideration, of the Excellency of that God whom we ſerve, and his Service, that can make the Heart to draw near and buſily attend, with Affections anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Service it's employed in. And what acceptance ſuch inconſiderate Service is like to find by him, that will conſider and weigh all our Services, and judge Righteouſly, you may ſee, <hi>Eſay</hi> 29.13. <hi>For as much as this People,</hi> he means the Jewiſh Hypocrites, <hi>draw near me with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Heart far from me.</hi> Therefore he threatens to bring heavy Judgments on them. Their Hearts muſt needs be far from God that conſiders it not, for that's the firſt and leading Act of the Soul that brings it on, and makes way for the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:134641:87"/>following Acts of Judgment. Complacency and Affection, without which there can be no reaſonable Service; and how well God will receive any other Service from a reaſonable Creature, it's a thing of eaſie underſtanding. What an high preſumption and affront is it to ſtand before God with the face and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his People, and to bow our ſelves with an external Reverence before him, when the Soul is idle, or otherwiſe employed; and there's nothing of Reverence or Worſhip in the Heart! What a provocation, to deal with God as your Cheats and Impoſtors deal with us, that make a ſhew to our Eye of things that are nothing ſo, and have no reality, but cheat and delude our Senſe! To uſe Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain and ſlight in the Service of God; and to conveigh a Prayer in the preſence of God, as if it came warm from the Heart, when it was never born any deeper than the Mouth. Be not deceived, God will not be mocked, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. Think not to ſerve the All-ſeeing God as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> ſerved <hi>Iſrael;</hi> nor to come and make a Covenant with God by Prayer, as if your Services came from a far Countrey, even from the depths and bottom of your Hearts, when they come no farther than the Throat, and are a meſs of meer wind and words; and theſe words are alſo nigh thee, even at thy Mouth; as the Apoſtle in another caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. You may laugh at an Ape when he bows to you and kiſſeth his hand, as if he meant you ſome high reſpect,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:134641:88"/>but you will not take your ſelf to be honoured thereby, much leſs will God take the geſtures of your Body and your outward Preſence, and the ſound of your Lips, and ſuch ridiculous Actions, for a ſubſtantial and rational Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; that Heart is dangerouſly miſtaken that thinks ſo. There's no Harmony in Gods Ear, unleſs Underſtanding, Judgment and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the outward Worſhip and reverend Deportment of the Body; all come together to make up the Quire; otherwiſe 'twill be the Sacrifice of a Fool, and ſuch as are fooliſh cannot ſtand in his ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. (1.) Either with approbation or without ſhame, and where there is no Conſideration nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Intention of Mind and Heart, there can be no other Sacrifice than this, nothing but meer cheating Formalities. <hi>Keep thy Foot therefore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> (that is) <hi>thy Heart) when thou entreſt upon the Service of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the Sacrifice of Fools;</hi> and why is it the Sacrifice of Fools? mark, the reaſon follows, <hi>For they conſider not that they do evil,</hi> Eccl. 5.1. This it is that betrays them and marrs all. If Conſideration ſtay at home, better thou hadſt never gone to Church, for God will be ſure to miſs that and hate ſuch Worſhip, where the moſt eſſential, vital part is wanting, and count thee a greater ſinner in ſome reſpect, than if thou hadſt kept away the Carcaſs alſo, ſince the Soul was wanting. <hi>Who is blind but my Servant, or deaf as my Meſſenger?</hi> Who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:134641:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Lords Servant, <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.19.

Well, it's want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, not only in the time of Service, but at other times, that puts them upon this abſurdity in their approaches to God; to give him the Eye and Mouth, and any thing but the Heart. The very Heathens themſelves, had more judicious manly thoughts of God than ſuch Chriſtians have. Their Books are ſtuff'd with ſuch ſayings, as imply inward Love and Reverence, to be more acceptable than the fateſt Sacrifice. I could multiply Sentences enough to ſuch a purpoſe, if I thought it were worth the while. Thus you ſee one ſad effect of Inconſideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the want of Conſideration doth multilate the Service of God, and cut out the very heart of it, ſo it makes it altogether taſteleſs and inſipid. It's impoſſible that God ſhould be ſerved in a due manner, and his Servants not feel the difference between his and all other Service, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?

And that there is no profit in the ſincere Worſhip of God; and that in keeping his Commandments there is no reward? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:134641:89"/>with the greateſt ſolemnity and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Where is the Man that can ſtep forth and ſay, that it's labour and loſs, and is not accompanied with the greateſt Honour, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Profit, unleſs it be the Hypocrites and formal Profeſſors, that ſlight it over; and whoſe Hearts are not engaged in the Work? <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? Verily there is a reward for the Righteous,</hi> Pſal. 58.11. I mean ſuch a one that comes not behind his Duty, but keeps company with it. You may ſafely and confidently aver, to him that ſoweth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs there is a ſure reward, as well as ſhall be, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.28. Many a refreſhing, joyful Song he hath whilſt he is ſcattering this Seed; what then will the joy of the Harveſt be, if Plowing and Sowing be ſuch a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Work? I confeſs in all other Service that doth not refer to this, the queſtion may be truly put, What doth it profit? Where is any pleaſure that my Heart and Soul can taſte and find? I have many a time come home by Weeping Croſs, when I have travelled hardeſt in the affairs and matters of this Life. But he that ſaith his Heart hath found no ſweetneſs nor reward in his approxima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God, and in the exerciſe of his Worſhip, if he underſtands himſelf, he doth but proclaim his Hypocriſie, and tell the World that his Heart is defective in the Work: That he doth not Worſhip his Maker and Redeemer in Spirit and in Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:134641:90"/>That he doth not conſider to whom he doth repair, nor what he may expect; nor who is ready to intercede for him, if he doth but look to him with a believing Heart; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if theſe things come under any due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he could not find no taſte nor ſweetneſs in ſuch a Service, nor return with ſuch a dry and empty Heart, from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of infinite Joy and Fulneſs. Could a Man come to the Sun and not be enlightened, and ſtand under it's warm refreſhing Beams and not be revived? Could a Man touch the Hem and Border of Chriſts Garment, and feel no Virtue come forth for his Refreſhment? much leſs can a Man ſtand in the preſence of his Glory, and have no reflections of Light and Comfort from him? You may as well ſay that a Man may feed upon the moſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Suſtenance, and concoct what he eats, and yet not thrive at all. As that a Man may thoroughly and ſeriouſly conſider the great ſanctifying Truths, and live under the power of ſuch Thoughts, and find nothing of Guſt and Reliſh in them. Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſome Degree, are as inſeparable from Grace, if Conſideration bring it into Exerciſe, as Light is from the Sun. And as Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doth gather ſtrength, and is more lively and vigorous, ſo will the Exerciſe of Grace be more fervent, and when Grace is upon the Wing, and in a haſty flight Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Virgins that are her Companions, Peace and Joy, and Comfort, I mean, will
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:134641:90"/>not be dead and unactive, but will, like the ſhadow, keep company and reſemblance with the Body to which they do belong. And they that are moſt frequent and ſtrong in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Grace, Faith, Love and Hope, will have the ſtronger and more frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations and Refreſhments. And therefore <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Faith and Love, and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, were continually working, had the the greater ſenſe and experience of this inward Joy and Comfort. And ſuch was the degree thereof oftentimes, that he could not contain himſelf, but he muſt needs break forth into Songs and Triumph. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte, yea, ſweeter than Honey to my Mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119.103. <hi>O how I love thy Law, it is my Meditation all the day, ver.</hi> 97. <hi>Thy Statutes have been my Songs in the Houſe of my Pilgrimage, ver.</hi> 54. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God muſt needs be tedious and irkſome to them that have their minds on ſomething elſe, and think not what a courteſie they do themſelves whilſt they draw near to God with the Heart. What a favour it is to approach ſuch a preſence? What an Honour it reflects upon them? and what advantage there comes in every way to him, that offers a Sacrifice fit for God to accept.</p>

By this time I hope our Eyes may be a little opened to ſee what a ſin it's to be defective in ſo great a Duty as Conſideration is; and therefore it's the more ſeaſonable to warn and beſeech you that you would not at one daſh blot out all true Worſhip of God, and ſolid Peace and Comfort out of your own Hearts, by a ſin ſo inconſiſtent with the Rational Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that God hath beſtowed upon Man. Muſt not he that hath made both Soul and Body, be worſhiped with both, and ſerved with their united ſtrength? As the Eye guides the Body, ſo doth Conſideration firſt ſtir up, and then ſteer and govern the Soul in all its operations; and therefore if you leave out that, the Soul cannot ſtir or move ſuitably to its Nature. If then Forgetfulneſs of God be a ſin, that you would not for all the World be found guilty of, at the great trying day, then be ſure not lay the Foundation of ſuch a guilt by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Conſideration. Uſe that Faculty in all things, if you would they ſhould be wiſely

                  <p>There are but two ſorts of Actions that a Man hath a capacity to produce, and in both we have to do with God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are ſome Actions that have God for their Object (or ſomething immediately ſubſervient to him) and their end alſo.

                  <p>In Study, the Object about which our Action is converſant, is that which our thoughts are exerciſed about, whither it be Names or Things. In Trafique the Object of our Action is that with or for which we Trafique. In Eating and Drinking the Object is our Meat and Drink. But the end in all theſe ſhould be the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God and the promoting his Glory, which is done when we ask Counſel of him, and humbly beg his Direction in all theſe, and heartily devote the Knowledge, the Strength, the Gain; which comes in by theſe Actions to the befriending of his Intereſt. Now in both theſe ſorts of Action (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted) we have chiefly to do with God, who is principally concerned; and therefore both of them muſt be guided by the Law of God, for the matters and manner of them, that they may attain their end; but do this, if you can, without Conſideration. <hi>The Heart is deceitful above all things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparatly wicked; who can know it?</hi> Jer. 17.9. It will make you believe that your intentions are upright, and that God's Honour is aimed at, when there is nothing elſe. If therefore you would not be deceived, believe not your own Hearts, much leſs the Tongues of others, that would flatter you into a good opinion of your ſelves. Judge not according to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſudden appearance of things, but judge Righteous Judgments. But this you can never do, if you <hi>Conſider</hi> not. There are depths in the Heart of Man, depths in all his Actions, depths in the Word of God, which is the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:134641:92"/>rule of them. The Devil hath a deep reach in his Temptations, whereby he ſets upon us, and manageth his Work with the greateſt Art and Cunning. The baits that he uſeth are not eaſily diſcerned. Vice and Wickedneſs is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oftentimes; Truth and Honeſty appears in a diſguiſe, and ſeem on a ſudden like him that was the perfection of Beauty, to have no Form nor Comelineſs in them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.2. Without Conſideration you can never ſearch theſe Myſteries, nor wade thorough theſe Depths. The careleſs and inconſiderate Man will be taken and inſnared; he will catch at a ſhew inſtead of a Subſtance. He will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace an Appearance inſtead of Death, and the way will ſeem right in his Eyes; the end whereof is the way of Truth. It's a fearful charge which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> faſtens upon the careleſs Jews, <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.8. <hi>There is no Judgment in their goings, they diſcern not where is ſafety nor where is danger.</hi> Such Perſons he knew could not eſcape Deſtruction. If you <hi>Conſider</hi> not there can be no judgment in your goings; you will be in danger every ſtep you tread; you will never find out your duty, nor be able to perform it; neither Faith nor Reaſon will bear any ſway in the courſe of your Life (for Conſideration puts theſe into power and authority) but Senſe will rule you, and you will live after the Fleſh, and ſo muſt take what follows. The Apoſtle tells you what that is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If you live after the Fleſh ye ſhall die;</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He that ſoweth to

If he had conſidered this he would never have made ſuch a fooliſh Choice as this, and neglected God and his Soul, for ſuch a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:134641:94"/>flying Senſual Happineſs as this is. Doth that Man that wanders after the World, and lets out his Heart to any preſent Enjoyments, and feeds upon Air, and the Breath of a few lying deceived Men, whilſt he ſeeks not the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of God, by an Humble, Holy and Heavenly Life, know and conſider what Dung and Droſs he hath prefered before an Eternal Crown of Glory? Let the event prove who was the wiſeſt and moſt conſidering Man, ſhe that hath choſen Heaven, or he that hath choſen Earth; he that hath renounced God, or he that hath renounced the World; and who is the moſt weak and crack'd Brain'd Perſon, he that ſtudies to pleaſe God, or he that ſtudies to humour the Fleſh, and to ſatisfie the Luſts thereof. I do not intend by what hath been ſpoken, to diſparage any of theſe lower Comforts, that are uſed with Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Thankfulneſs and Sobriety, and that do not lift up Mens Hearts with Pride and Inſolency, and make them the more Impious, Oppreſſive and Intollerable, the more they have of them; nor negligent in their ſtudy to pleaſe God, and care to promote that which is right in his ſight. But my deſign is to ſhew the Vertue of <hi>Conſideration,</hi> that makes ſuch a vaſt difference between Man and Man; and makes the one to dig ſo deep and lay his Foundation ſo ſure, that his Happineſs ſhall laſt for ever; and the other to chuſe the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that ſhall laſt but two or three ſcore years at longeſt; it may be not the tenth part ſo
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:134641:94"/>long. And as <hi>Conſideration</hi> makes ſo vaſt a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Ends, that Men deſign and intend, and makes one chuſe Heaven, and an Eternal Life with God, for his Portion and Treaſure; and to ſet his Heart upon it, and to make it his ultimate End. And another for want of it, to ſet his Heart on a little fading Beauty, Lying Honour, Periſhing Riches, or unſatisfying Pleaſure, or Carnal Wiſdom, to be guilty of the greateſt Folly, that he may ſwagger a little while. So it makes as wide difference in the Means, and prevails with ſome to humble them, that God may in his due time exalt them, to emyloy their thoughts how to mortifie their Affections to the World, how to ſtrengthen the Love of God, to root their Faith more deeply, by a more frequent Exerciſe of it, and how to get their Hearts more affected with the wonderful love of Chriſt. This makes them ſo frequent in Prayer, ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive upon the Word, ſo intent upon all Chriſts appointed Means, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Spiritual Underſtanding and Love; when the <hi>Inconſiderate</hi> can diſpence with theſe for a little worldly Gain or Eaſe, and prefer Earthly Toyl and Labour, before a little pains to get the true Wiſdom, and to ſave their Souls.</p>
                  <p>In the Name of God therefore, I beſeech you, to <hi>conſider,</hi> if you would not be guilty of the greateſt dotage, and miſcarry in the choice of your End; and conſequently of all the means. If you would not take a Dream
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:134641:95"/>for Happineſs, and ſpend your Strength for nought, and be forced to confeſs your Folly when you come to die. Force your ſelves to <hi>Conſider,</hi> eſpecially when you have the beſt advantages to promote <hi>Conſideration;</hi> when you have Time, Leiſure, Health, ſeaſonable Inſtruction from the Word and Providence of God; and you feel more ſenſible Conviction of the worth of God's Favour, and the vanity of all things; then conſider and ſet it home, and drive on to a Reſolution to forget God no longer. <hi>Conſideration</hi> will help you to do this if you will follow it, and encourage your ſelves to it, and not check your Minds when they are thus employed. Plead not your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Unskilfulneſs, do it as well as you can, and uſe will make you more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert; much leſs plead your Impotency, and pretend that you are utterly unable.</p>
                  <p>If a little Worldly Trouble come upon you, you can conſider how to get out or ſhake off the Trouble. If you are under a Reproach, and a little Contempt of Men, you can Conſult and Conſider how you may wipe it off, and vindicate your Name and Credit. But oh what thoughts of Heart, and wiſe and deep <hi>Conſideration</hi> to ſecure Life it ſelf, and the Comforts that are neareſt and deareſt to it? Theſe are Signs that we have the Faculty, and can <hi>Conſider</hi> about thoſe things that we value, or have any love to. That Men are therefore ſo <hi>Inconſiderate</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:134641:95"/>in the Concernments of their Souls, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matters of another Life. It's an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sign they value them not, they care not for them; to awaken ſuch therefore, and put them upon this great and neceſſary Work, I ſhall ſuggeſt theſe following Propoſals:</p>
                  <div type="subsection">

                        <hi>FIrſt,</hi> You have matters of the greateſt importance and neceſſity to <hi>Conſider.</hi> If it were only to live happily here, and to eſcape the miſeries of this Life, it's worth <hi>Conſideration</hi> to bring this about; but it is an Everlaſting Life and Happineſs that we are to provide for, which if we do not compaſs, it's not the loſs of this that will be our only Miſery, though it be an unſpeakable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Loſs. But you muſt bear alſo the Wrath of God, that will kindle on you like a devouring Fire, and the Fury of a guilty awakened Conſcience, that will fall upon you like a Tempeſt, and fright your Soul into Everlaſting Dread and Horror. And doth it not mightily concern us to <hi>Conſider</hi> how to eſcape all this? If thou haſt any love to thy own Soul, when the Quſtion is whether thou ſhalt live or die for ever, thou wilt <hi>Conſider</hi> and thoroughly reſolve thy ſelf.</p>

                     <p>If thou hadſt loſt a dear and powerful Friend, on whoſe Favour all thy Worldly Hopes did depend, thou wouldſt not refuſe to let thy Thoughts run upon ſuch a Subject as this is, neither would it be tedious to thee to Conſider how thou mighteſt obtain thy Pardon and regain his Favour. The caſe is Ten thouſand times worſe, incomparably more ſad. You have loſt the Favour of God, and are fallen under his Diſpleaſure, and you are like to periſh for ever, unleſs <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> bring you to bewail your loſs, and ſin, which is the cauſe of it, and bring you to Repentance, and ſo prepare you to believe in Chriſt. If you had ſome great buſineſs to diſpatch, intricate and doubtful, you would endanger your Eſtate or Life, if it were either neglected or imprudently managed; who would not ſummon up all the Reaſon that he hath, and conſider well how he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch it as ſucceſsfully as he can? And do you not perceive how abſurd it is to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, how your preſent Life is ordered, that muſt decide the Caſe and Detriment how you ſhall live for ever; and not to <hi>Conſider,</hi> and that to purpoſe, how you may get Chriſt for your Friend to procure your Acceptance with God; how to get the Holy Spirit of Promiſe to dwell in you, to turn the ſtream of your Affections from Earth to Heaven, and to ſubdue your Corruptions, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and encourage you againſt Temptations,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:134641:96"/>to put you upon your Duty, and to enable you to a right Performance? You will lay by ſuch works as this, or do it in a mad and careleſs faſhion; if you do not Conſider why and how it muſt be done. It's <hi>Conſideration</hi> that muſt ſhew you the truth and certainty of the Life to come, the Glory of Heaven, and what an intollerable loſs it is to fall ſhort of it: It's that muſt ſhew you what a Debter you are to God and to your Redeemer, and the worth and excellency of your Soul, and the neceſſity of a renewed Holy Nature, and of an Humble and Self-denial Life. <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I ſay, muſt needs ſhew theſe things and affect your Heart with them, and make you ſenſible how much they do import, and how nearly they do concern you, or you will never do them; you'll rather take the brutiſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments that Inconſideracy will make you reliſh, and chuſe the Pleaſures of Delirancy and Madneſs, rather than pay ſo dear for true Wiſdom as you muſt, if you are a ſtranger to the fore-mentioned <hi>Conſideration,</hi> I ſay (pay dear) in reſpect of the Fleſh and it's ſinful Contentments, which muſt loſe their Lives in the Service of God and your own Souls, though it will be unſpeakably cheap, when you have paid the moſt in this kind. O how doth it import us to know God as our <hi>Maker, Lord and Governour,</hi> in ſuch a manner as doth affect and captivate our Hearts to a voluntary and wilful ſubjection to him, as our only Felicity? How much doth it concern
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:134641:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>us to get ſuch a clear ſight of his amiable, lovely Nature, and moſt tranſcendent Perſections, as may poſſeſs our Souls with the higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of him, and kindle the ſtrongeſt love to him! that the Remembrance of him may be our ſweeteſt daily Exerciſe and Imployment. But without <hi>Conſideration</hi> you cannot approach him, nor get any transforming reviving ſight of him. His Ways are in the Seas, and his Paths are in the deep Waters, and Foot-ſteps cannot be known, nor track'd without frequent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of your Conſidering Faculty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we have the matters of greateſt importance and neceſſity to <hi>Conſider,</hi> ſo we have many ſpecial advantages to excite and awaken <hi>Conſideration.</hi> One would think the worth and weightineſs of the Object, ſhould be ſpur enough to quicken us to this Work, and command our thoughts, if there were no other motive to prick us forward; but we have many current helps, many a loud call from the Word of God, ſet on by his appointed Servants, that are ſent forth on purpoſe upon this Errand. Many providential help, both ſweet and terrible, and ſomething beſides the common courſe, ſtrange and unuſual, and therefore more fit to ſet the Mind a thinking, from what cauſe they come, and what they drive at. The veryeſt Atheiſt is ſometime blank'd, at ſome ſtrange and unheard of events, and knows not what interpretation to make of them, nor whether to refer them; for having

When a Blaſphemer is ſtruck dead in the very Act of his Blaſphemy, and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance lights upon another, with a fearful imprecation in his Mouth; and ſome effects are ſo <hi>anomalous,</hi> and beſides the courſe of Nature, that it is no thanks to the moſt Atheiſtical to bring in their Witneſs, and to confeſs the Wiſdom and Power, and Juſtice of God. Let a Man that truly worſhippeth and feareth God, in ſuch a time of dreadful and publick Calamity as this is, applaud the Juſtice of God, and freely confeſs his handy work, and aſſign the notorious, publick, allowed, and encouraged ſins of the City and Nation, for the meritorious and provoking Cauſe. It may be a purblind thick ſighted Beaſt, whoſe God is his Belly, and whoſe Glory is his Shame, that is drunk with Senſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 9.13. will tell you that ſuch a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality comes about in the revolution and circle of ſo many years; and will rake the Kennel for the Cauſe, and aſcribe the effects to the

They cannot now laugh out of their Hearts all ſerious thoughts of a Life to come, nor make a jeſt of a Holy Life, as they did in the day of their deluſion; but would give a World, if they had it, to die the death of the Righteous. No wonder that ſtrange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Providences, whether they be of Mercy or Judgment, joſtle the moſt ſottiſh and inconſiderate Mind, and awaken it to think other thoughts of all things than they did before, and enforce an Heatheniſh, Earthly Mind, that ſpent all its thoughts upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity before; to ſay that all is but vanity, and God's Favour is the only ground for true Contentment, if this good fit would laſt which <hi>Conſideration</hi> hath brought him to: But alas, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:134641:98"/>things run in a conſtant Channel, and keep a conſtant courſe, God is not in all his thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. Now they think that Repentance and Faith, and Self-denial, are the work of Cowards, yes, and ſuch as believe, that God hath as great hand in the orderly courſe and motion of things, as when they go out of order; and Water that is a fluid body and ſhould run, ſtands ſtill; and Fire that ſhould burn, doth not. Let but a Man conſider, and it's as eaſie to believe, that its as great a power muſt enable the Sun to run it's race, as to ſtand ſtill or go backward; to preſerve the Societies of Men, as deſtroy and waſte them with a devouring Plague. All the difference is, Men now conſider, that would not before, and conclude at leaſt, that it's the ſafeſt courſe to live the Life of the Righteous, though there were no God; and oh that all would ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and hold faſt ſuch a concluſion, and live accordingly; then they would quickly ſee more and more evidence of God in the Word, and the neceſſity of his Service, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his ways, and riſe up to a higher concluſion. That when, as before, they could ſay it was the ſafeſt way to renounce worldly Pleaſure, and to mortifie their Luſts, and to addict themſelves to the Love and Service o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:134641:99"/>of ſuch pretended Wiſdom; and among other helps, this of <hi>Publick Calamity,</hi> where Plague or Famine, or any extraordinary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſweeps away thouſands, calls the reſt to come and behold the works of the Lord, what Deſolations he hath wrought among us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Be ſtill and know that I am God, I will be exalted among the People, I will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by theſe careleſs and Atheiſtical Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> ver. 11.

Doth it not give ſome check whether we will or not, to the external acts of Pride, Luxury and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, whereby the inward Acts are weakened; and we have time to reaſon with our ſelves, and are better diſpoſed to conſider, when freed from the clog of worldly cares, and from the fumes of a ſurfeited Body, overcharged with Meat and Drink, and from the flattering Friend that make us believe we are well, when our caſe is too much to be lamented; and God hath not left <hi>this Town</hi> altogether without this Mercy.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As Conſideration is a work of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity (where there is time and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity) in regard of the worth and greatneſs of the matters, which ſo much concern us; and in regard of the help and aſſiſtance that God gives us to this duty: ſo the Fruit and Benefits of Conſideration are unſpeakably great: <hi>I ſhall name two:</hi>

                     <p n="1">1.

On the other ſide, when the Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Perſon, whom God hath afflicted, is pur-blind, and can ſee no farther than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome Air, a bad Dyet, an envious, troubleſome Neighbour, or the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion now among us, by the which he thinks he is afflicted in his Eſtate, Name or Health (I ſay) when the Inconſiderate Perſon, either in Proſperity or Adverſity, ſtops here, and goes no further; the conſiderate Perſon is wiſe indeed, and looks above and beyond all theſe, and ſeeth the Spring that ſetteth all the Wheels a going, the primitive and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling cauſe, that commands all the other.</p>

And this influence they will have in a ſincere degree and meaſure upon all true Believers; neither will they make any ſinful haſte to get away from the Rod, when God ſendeth it; they know nothing can come without his ſpecial appointment.

I confeſs, his Soul alſo may ſeem to be content, whilſt he hath a fulneſs of Earthly Proſperity; but that's but a meer negative, and no poſitive Act, whereas true Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſomething poſitive. And that Soul that hath it, doth not only hold its peace, and ſay nothing to the contrary, but with deliberation ſpeaketh Peace to a Man, upon the ſureſt and moſt infallible grounds. The plain truth is, the Soul of an ambitious and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous Worldling, may ſeem to be ſatisfied and acquieſce, if he hath what the World can afford him, becauſe he doth not believe or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:134641:102"/>conſider, <hi>The end of all things is at hand,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.7. But ſenſe hath a full maſtery over him, being gratified to the full, and doth make the Mind drunk, that it cannot make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial enquiry into the worth of what the Man for the preſent is ſo much pleaſed with. O if ſuch a one did conſider and believe, he would like his condition worſe than that of the vileſt Begger. He could not look into the Word of God and ſee ſuch dreadful paſſages againſt thoſe that have their Affections ſet upon the World and Pleaſures thereof, nor read the terrible Deſcription of thoſe Men that have the Riches of this World, and are not rich towards God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.21. and not tremble, and even throw away ſuch Earthly Luggage, that is ſuch an impediment in the way to Salvation, if he could not be otherwiſe rid of it.</p>
                     <p>And as the inconſiderate Mans great and principal End is no higher, ſo he is as fooliſh and void of Underſtanding in his choice of the means whereby he would attain his End. Alas, that ever Men that have ſuch excellent parts and means for their Improvement, that are bred up to more Underſtanding than other Men, ſhould ſo diſparage their very Reaſon and Judgmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, as to think that Hawking and Hunting, and Carding and Dicing, and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Feaſting, and ſuch like Courſes, ſhould bring a Man to Content and Happineſs. If they did but conſider, they could not poſſibly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:134641:102"/>judge this, unleſs their Reaſon were beſotted, and there were ſome conſiderable flaw in their underſtanding Faculty. I deny not, but in reference to their intended End, they have made a wiſe and prudent choice, and hit upon the fitteſt means. Their end being the pleaſing of the Fleſh, what can they do more wiſely than to make proviſion for it, to fulfil the Luſts and Deſires thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. and to live at Eaſe? And ſo the Children of this World, as our Saviour hath affirmed, are wiſer in their Generation than the Children of Light, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.8. Their end (though by accident) being to loſe the Life which is to come, what can they do more ſhrewdly than to ſave this preſent Life? Since their end is to deſtroy their Souls, can they take a more prudent courſe than to love the World and the things of the World, and keep all thoughts of a future ſtate out of their Minds, as much as may be, leſt they ſhould be converted and ſaved? <hi>This their way is their folly,</hi> Pſal. 49.13.</p>
                     <p>But the Man that <hi>Conſiders</hi> will look higher, and be ſure to project for all Eternity, and make nothing his chief End but what will never fail; and therefore hath a wiſer reach than the moſt applauded admired Wit that is Earthly Minded. And he is as wiſe in the choice of the means whereby he makes towards his End; they being no other than what God himſelf hath preſcribed, and therefore can never miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:134641:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>his End is to ſave his Life for ever; and therefore he will venture to loſe it here, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.39. His end is to get him Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Honour, and to embalm his Name to all Eternity, and therefore he doth rejoyce when Men revile him and ſpeak all evil of him falſly for Chriſts ſake. Thus you ſee, that <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> maketh a Man truly and ſolidly wiſe. This is the firſt benefit of <hi>Conſideration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſideration</hi> is a work accompanied with the ſweeteſt Pleaſure and Contentment. The meer agitation and exerciſe of the Intellectual is ſweet to one that knows how to employ them. But when moreover the Objects of the Mind are ſuch as do enlighten, purifie, and rejoyce the Heart, ſuch a Man, if he know how to manage the work, muſt needs advance himſelf to a high degree of pleaſure. The reaſon why ſome Chriſtians grow weary and faint in the Service of God, and walk heavily in the bitterneſs of their Souls, a great part of their Life, if not all, is becauſe they do not more frequently approach the Fountain of Joy and Gladneſs in their Meditations of him, and do not ſo well conſider the evil of Sin to forſake it more heartily, nor clear up their intereſt in Chriſt, and Evidences for Heaven by daily <hi>Conſideration.</hi> Were theſe things better conſidered, they would be better known, and what a pleaſure would it be, to think upon God and Heaven, and Chriſt, if we had but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:134641:104"/>this. As it is Reaſon and Underſtanding that makes a Man differ from a Bruit, and become more excellent than a Beaſt; ſo Conſideration is nothing elſe but the uſe of his Reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he muſt needs live like a Beaſt. To ſpeak plainly, he that will not uſe his Reaſon and conſider, and ſo live like a Man that ſhould be guided by this higher Principle; he will be guided by a lower Principle, and be led by Senſe and Feeling, as a Beaſt is. And a little that is preſent and felt, ſhall weigh more with ſuch a one, than one that's to come, though ten times greater. Hence it is, that though God threaten a wicked Man, and one that lives by ſenſe, with Hell and Damnation, it hath no force nor power with him to reſtrain his Corruption, becauſe he feels it not, though he might as certainly foreſee it, as that which he now feels. And he will do more to be rid of the Tooth-ach, or ſome preſent Affliction, than to prevent one that's a thouſand times greater. Is he guided by Reaſon or Senſe, and doth he live like a Man that hath Underſtanding, or like a Bruit that hath none, that will take more care and pains, and be at more coſt, to be freed from preſent Pain and Sickneſs, and to get out of Poverty or Hardſhip, when it pincheth him, and to throw off any preſent Burthen that he feels himſelf oppreſſed with, than to eſcape the Damnation of Hell, though he muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe moſt certainly feel it ere long? Judge impartially, whether this be not, to be like
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:134641:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Horſe and Mule, and other meer ſenſitive Creatures, that have no Underſtanding. Let them have what they have at preſent, and feel no preſent Pain, and you pleaſe them well enough, though you feed them for the Slaughter. You cannot Shoe an Ox, unleſs you bind and caſt him down and force him, though it be to keep his Feet from hurt. Your Horſe is not pleaſed when you let him Blood, though it ſave his Life, becauſe you hurt them for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>The Man that conſiders not, will be too like theſe Brutiſh Creatures, and run into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miſery, to avoid a little preſent Affliction. Moreover,</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly, It's eaſie to Conſider;</hi> your Thoughts will run ſome way, whether you will or not. The Soul of Man is a buſie active thing, and will not be idle, it will rather be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently employed, than not at all; and the bare work of thinking is no hard matter. It's rather a work of difficulty to reſtrain them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially from the things that we have the higheſt Love and Reſpect for. If God and thy Soul were valued and loved by thee above all other things, as they muſt be if thou art a Chriſtian at the Heart, thou couldſt not but think, and think again, how to pleaſe the one and ſave the other. If things that are more worth than the whole Frame of Heaven and Earth, and all that's viſible to the Eyes, are not worthy thy moſt prizing, pleaſing Thoughts, they are worth nothing; and if thou thinkeſt ſo, thou art either an ignorant Sot or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt. It's a cheap purchaſe to gain the higheſt Wiſdom and the Love of God, and to ſave thy Soul for ever, at the expence of a few ſober, ſerious thoughts. If you ſtick at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which it muſt coſt you if ever you be ſaved; you judge your ſelves unworthy of Eternal Life. It's eaſie enough to you to turn your Thoughts to an Object of Gain or Pleaſure; and is there any greater Gain than to ſave your Souls? What will it profit you to win the whole World and loſe your Souls? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. It's a rational queſtion that the greedy Heart of Man ſhall never be able to anſwer, without Self-condemnation, if he run
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:134641:105"/>his Soul upon deſtruction; though he ſhould get to be the happieſt man upon Earth. O unhappy Soul, that couldſt conſider and Judge no better! Waſt thou maſter of no more Brains and Wit, than what could inform thee how to Feed and Trick up thy Carkaſs, and commend it to the Eyes of a few dying men? And to live in a little Credit, whilſt thou art above ground, though thy Name ſtink for ever afterwards? Was this the upſhot of all thy Thoughts? Couldſt thou think to better for thy poor Soul! that might be Eternally Happy; if you would not fly conſideration, but turn your Thoughts to thoſe things for which God gave to you your faculty to Think. O remember, that it's eaſie and very natural to conſider how you may ſave your Soul, if you were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unnatural and cruel to your ſelves. And it will ſhame you unto the deepeſt ſilence; when God ſhall ask you: Why you did not <hi>Conſider</hi> of thoſe things, when the matters were ſo great, and the work ſo eaſie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> You will conſider when it is too late, and wiſh that you had made more haſt, when it would have done you good. It would not be ſuch a perfect degree of madneſs, in us not to conſider, how wonderfully God hath made us, how deeply we ſtand Indebted to him, for no leſs than all that we have, or hope for; and how wickedly we have departed from him, and what our ſin hath deſerved, and what our Saviour hath done, ſave us from the woful conſequents thereof; it would not be ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:134641:106"/>abſurd to put theſe Thoughts out of our Minds now, if we could always keep them out. But in the latter end we ſhall conſider, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.20. It would not be ſo great a ſin to be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate now, if we could be ever ſo: But alas! ſtupidity, and inſenſibleneſs of ſuch things as theſe, is the diſeaſe only of this preſent Life; and will laſt no longer than the day of Grace: And woe to us a thouſand times if it laſt ſo long: But when the day of Mercy is paſt, be ſtupid if thou canſt, and harden thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Thoughts if thou art able. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is now our duty, and the fitteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to ſhow us the evil of Sin and the worth of Grace; but if it be here neglected, it ſhall be our puniſhment hereafter, and the moſt cruel inſtrument to torment us. Believe it then, we ſhall paſſionately wiſh that we had conſidered a little ſooner, and had let theſe things ſink into our hearts: O that we had pondered them whilſt we had the day! But now the fearful night is come upon us, and we are Sentenced everlaſtingly to ſuch diſmal Thoughts! If we had ſpent a few ſerious Thoughts what this miſery is to which we are now condemned, we had eſcaped theſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If we had conſidered what it is to be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. and to be forſaken of all comfort for ever; we had not been now pouring forth theſe bitter cryes and complaints: But alas! what are they now worth, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth them, or is moved to any the leaſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:134641:106"/>compaſſion towards: Yea the righteous God will laugh at your calamity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. and the Saints will praiſe him; and ſay, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou, O Lord, in the Sentence which thou haſt paſſed, in the Judgment which thou haſt executed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.137. Thou haſt pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth thy wrath and indignation on them, and given them gall and bitterneſs to drink, for they are worthy. You ſhall then wiſh that your faculty to conſider were gone; it will follow you ſo cloſe, and be ſuch a perpetual honour to you; or rather that you had never had reaſon and underſtanding to conſider, then you might have both liv'd and died like a beaſt: Whereas now, though you have liv'd like a beaſt, that you muſt die like a man that hath Memory, Reaſon, Foreſight, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Affections, that will all conſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to overwhelm you with eternal ſhame. Why had I reaſon, will the Soul ſay then, but to prevent this miſery? Why had I will to chooſe, when Life and Death were ſet before me, and could chooſe no better? Had it not been a wiſer courſe to have troubled my ſelf a little while with ſome few Thoughts of it, then now to feel it for ever? Why did God threaten Hell and deſtruction in his Word, and ſet it forth with ſo much Terrour to mine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, but that I might conſider and eſcape it? Why did he appoint the Miniſterial Office; but that knowing the Terrours of the Lord, they might perſwade men? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. What could nothing prevail with one, but what I now feel, and muſt forever undergo?
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:134641:107"/>Think not to ſay then, I had not time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, neither had I skill to follow ſuch a work as this: It's not ſo much a knowing Head, as an honeſt Heart that's required to this work. The Truths are but few and plain that thy Heart is to dwell upon, and the certainty of them is beyond all doubt and queſtion: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difference of Opinion there may be in other things, yet here is no controverſy; all are agreed, that man hath an Immortal Soul; that there is a Life to come: That the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of man lies in theſe two things. 1.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:134641:108"/>and phantaſtick pleaſures, and put a picture into his hand inſtead of real felicity: It would clear his Eye-ſight, and make him quite of another mind, than once he was, when <hi>Inconſideracy</hi> had blinded him, and the world had befool'd him; and he would ſee much more reaſon to live in the love of God, looking for the mercies of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer unto eternal Life, <hi>Jude</hi> the 21. than ever he did to live in carnal love and delights: <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> would bring the world and all its pleaſures as much into diſgrace, as ever <hi>Inconſideracy</hi> brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O what a bleſſing hath God beſtowed upon the man or woman to whom he hath given a conſidering mind: How quickly is ſuch a man promoted, and brought to unſpeakable honour; yea to find approbation with God! Such a man is quickly higher by head and ſhoulders (as its ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi>) than the reſt of the inconſiderate doting World: <hi>I have more underſtanding</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) than all my teachers, for thy Teſtimonies are my meditation,</hi> Pſal. 119.99.

Sins of Infirmity, ſuch as are committed through the unavoidableneſs, unrulineſs of our Senſe, Phantaſy or Paſſion, which are not wholly under the power and command of Reaſon, no not when it is truly enlightned and ſanctified. 3. Such as are committed with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Deliberation, when it is in our power to avoid them, and will not; what theſe are, I need not inform you, every one may be his own judge: Theſe laſt ſort are called by ſome, <hi>Sins of Malice;</hi> and how much ſuch ſins as theſe will hinder all duty, as well as <hi>Conſideration,</hi> there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian of any experience, but knows too well: And therefore <hi>David</hi> prayeth eſpecially againſt ſuch ſins as theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Keep back thy ſervant from</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:134641:110"/>Preſumptuous Sins, <hi>let them not have dominion over me; then ſhall I be upright and innocent from the great tranſgreſſion:</hi> If thou haſt any good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this duty, and art convinc'd, that thy Soul will certainly periſh without frequent ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; thou haſt need to take heed of ſuch ſins as theſe: Believe it, theſe will wound thy Conſcience, break thy inward peace, mightily provoke the Lord, and draw away the Spirit from thee, and fill thee with diſturbing fears, and beſot thy mind, that it ſhall not be fit for Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; or if not, ſuch ſins as theſe will diſpoſe thee to hide thy ſelf, and get into thee dark and ſlie conſideration, as that which will diſcover thy ſhame, and make thee odious to thy ſelf: Never think to bend thy mind to an impartial conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God and his Attributes, and the Equity of Laws, nor to think of thy latter end, and the life to come, to any purpoſe, or to hear a right anſwer from thy Soul, when thou putteſt the queſtion whether it be ſanctified or unſanctified, whilſt thou giveſt thy conſent, and alloweſt thy ſelf to live in any known ſin. I may ſay of <hi>Conſideration,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> ſaid of <hi>Prayer, That it will make thee leave ſuch preſumptuous ſinning;</hi> Or elſe ſuch ſins will make thee to caſt off <hi>Conſideration;</hi> you may as well hope to reconcile light and darkneſs, as to bring theſe to any agreement. Where <hi>Conſideration</hi> is in any ſtrength, there will be no wilful ſin, or elſe Hell it ſelf: Art thou one that alloweſt thy ſelf in the habitual neglect of any known duty? Canſt thou freely indulge thy ſelf in any unjuſt or ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice? Are thy Thoughts at liberty to think vainly and wickedly without curb or controll? Is
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:134641:111"/>thy Tongue at liberty to utter falſhood and deceit, to call evil good, or good evil, to plead any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous cauſes, or to diſgrace any way that thou knoweſt in thy Conſcience God approveth of? Art thou wilfully proud, or uncharitable; and art thou intemperate in thy Appetite, or Paſſions, or commonly guilty of any ſuch ſin, that thy own Conſcience doth condemn? No wonder then if <hi>Conſideration</hi> be an unpleaſant work to thee, and if thy Thoughts turn away from him that abhorreth all iniquity, but that eſpecially which is wilful and allowed: It is no marvel that Meditation is ſeldom or never, in the word of the Lord that condemneth ſuch practices, as you can allow and approve, and ſets a black mark upon all thoſe in whom there is any reigning ſin: Take heed ſin committed with deliberation and allowance is not far from it, for one ſuch ſin mightily diſpoſeth to another; and where once ſuch ſins are ordinary and habitual, it ſhews that ſin hath gotten the dominion: But the mind will not be ſo averſe to thy duty, that hath a reſpect to all the Commandments, and that doth not give toleration to any one ſin, that it knows to be ſuch, but doth confeſs ſhame himſelf for, ſtrive and Pray againſt every corruption that he is conſcious to himſelf of: I know ſome difficulty there will be after all, but yet ſuch as will eaſily yield, and be overcome, when once this grand impediment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: And no ſin hath your allowance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but is ſeriouſly rejected and oppoſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. The next great enemy to this neceſſary duty of <hi>Conſideration,</hi> is a fond and inordinate delight in any thing here on earth: For where there is ſuch a doting love, your Thought will be continually at
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:134641:111"/>the command of that beloved object, and all the other Affections will be ſtill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the command of that doting love: If it be ſomething in preſent poſſeſſion, your heart will be dayly with it; or if it be off a little while, it is not at reſt; or elſe it's doing ſomething that may root this inordinate love, and make it faſter and ſtronger; its main care is to keep faſt hold, and its only fear is leſt it ſhould be deprived of it. And Conſideration there will be little or none, unleſs it be to keep out the light of thoſe Truths that would ſpoile the pleaſure of ſuch an Idolized comfort. Poſſibly there may be in ſuch a heart ſome Thoughts of God and the Life to come, eſpecially in thoſe that are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently told, and in part convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch Thoughts; but whilſt ſuch a fooliſh love prevaileth, ſuch Thoughts will come to nothing, and be made of none effect; or if the heart be thus inordinatly ſet upon a thing, that is not yet in its poſſeſſion; thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires will be ſo eager and impatient after it, that there will be neither time nor room for ſuch <hi>Conſideration</hi> as I am now perſwading thee to, whilſt thy mind is diſturbed and vexed with ſuch inſolent Paſſions as theſe; you may eaſily imagine, with what Tergverſation and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs it will come to ſuch a work as this, as doth diſcover that ſinfulneſs and folly of them: Every thing naturally ſeeketh its own preſervation; and ſo we muſt expect that luſt will do alſo, it will keep poſſeſſion ſo long as it's able; its hard to purſue any worldly pleaſure with heat and paſſion, and at the ſame time to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:134641:112"/>enter upon any ſerious <hi>Conſideration</hi> of the vanity of it; it's not caſie to let the affections looſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſinful and unlawful delights, and with all to conſider impartially at the ſame time, the fearfulneſs of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſuch practices: There's nothing can be well done, where Love doth not lead the way; and how can Spiritual love prevail, where Carnal Farthly love hath got dominion: I know God can bring ſuch a man to <hi>Conſideration,</hi> that hath captivated his heart to ſome Earthly delight, otherwiſe it were hard to think how he could be brought to Repentance; but then uſually the ſtrength and vehemency of the affection is abated, either by the power of God's Word, or ſome affliction or other, before the mind will be brought to any ſober <hi>Conſideration:</hi> But yet I ſay, whilſt ſuch inordinate love is in exerciſe and ſtrength, it will keep out <hi>Conſideration,</hi> and ſet the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that if ſuch a one would have his mind at liberty to <hi>Conſider,</hi> he muſt draw the Fewel that feedeth Affection, and weaken it by a reſolved Abſtinence from that which is its nouriſhment, and ſubmit to any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that God ſendeth for his help, and be glad of ſuch a bleſſed advantage to bring him to his right mind again, otherwiſe that work of <hi>Conſideration</hi> will go but heavily on; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the things to be conſidered are ſo much of another nature, and ſo oppoſite to all Carnal, Fleſhly love and delights whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another great hindrance to <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> will be the Company and Talk of more worldly men: You ſhall be ſure to meet with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:134641:112"/>nothing from ſuch Fellowſhip as this that will animate and quicken you to ſuch Thoughts as theſe; if your mind be never ſo little diſpoſed to meditate in the Law of God, and think of a future reckoning and account, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what preparation is made towards it; you ſhall find enough in their Frothy, Idle, Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or Sinful diſcourſe to quench ſuch Thoughts, and to bend your mind quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; but nothing to promote or ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any good inclination or deſire: Alas, the the heart of man is naturally too backward to Sober and Impartial <hi>Conſideration</hi> of the moſt concerning matters, that we have need of all the help we can get to put the mind in ſuch Heavenly frame and temper, and need not any thing to pull back and diſcourage: It's neceſſary to retire from the company and converſe of thoſe that are good, when we would attend this work to any purpoſe, much more from the Society of men whoſe Tongues are continually imployed about vanity and ſin: But if thou wouldſt be fit for the <hi>Conſideration</hi> that I am preſſing on thee, avoid ſuch Company as this, not only when thou art more ſolemnly addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thy ſelf to this work, but alſo at other times alſo: For ſuch Companions will be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy mind with ſuch empty notions and impreſſions as will pervert it, and keep out ſuch matter that ſhould furniſh and ſupply it for the ſucceſsful peformance of this duty: O how doth the Chatt and fooliſh Talk of Idle Light-headed men damp any good Seed in thee, and weaken all good affections! and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:134641:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>therefore muſt needs be a deadly enemy to the <hi>Conſideration</hi> which ſhould be promoted thereby: I appeal to thoſe that have their Ears continually filled with diſcourſe about the matters of this Life, about their Flocks and their Herds, and their Lands and their Trades, where the Fair is to day, and where the Market is to Morrow, and what News is ſtirring (to ſay no worſe) how hard is it to get any Reverential Thoughts of God, or any affecting apprchenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Life to come: It is no eaſie matter to get thy heart affected with thy ſin, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief it hath done thee, and that woful ſtate and condition of thoſe that die in it, when thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is altogether of another nature.

                  </gap>ment. Let me tell you there's nothing of ſuch conſequence as thoſe things that are to fall under our conſideration: And do you think a mind diſtract with worldly cares is fit for ſuch a work as this? It is not eaſie to be affected with the eye of God that's ever on us, and to ſtand always in awe of him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs frequent, ſerious conſideration make way. And who can do that, that hath one worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or another perpetually in his mind? And is even burthened and oppreſſed with ſuch thoughts. As the eye of the body is diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the violent motion of the Wind or Air; ſo the eye of the underſtanding is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, by buſie, confuſed and tumultuous thoughts: And although they that have their heads continually exerciſed and imployed in worldly buſineſs are very ſubject to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder, yet even thoſe alſo that have not their hands very much imployed, may have their hearts in continual diſturbance, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, and may have as little vacancy and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for ſuch conſideration, as thoſe that are over head and ears in the World, and are as buſie all the day long as if they were labouring for a Crown or Kingdom. It is an unvaluable mercy to have a free compoſed and undiſturbed mind, and to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:134641:114"/>have vacancy and leiſure to ask a mans ſelf what he is doing? and whether it will yield him comfort when he is paſſing out of the World? Many have bitterly repented them that they have had ſo many Irons in the Fire, and that with <hi>Martha,</hi> they have been <hi>careful and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for many things,</hi> whilſt they have neglected the <hi>one thing neceſſary, Luke</hi> 10.41. Let their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be a warning unto us that the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing cares of the world do not either prevent or elſe ſmother and choke better thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another grand obſtruction to the work of neceſſary conſideration, is pride, in all the kinds thereof: As God deals with pride, ſo pride deals with him; He looks upon the proud, and the proud look upon him afar off; or rather he regardeth them not at all, nor they him: The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not conſider and ſeek after God; <hi>God is not in all his thoughts, Pſal.</hi> 10.4. His wayes are alwayes grievous to him. <hi>They are far above out of his ſight,</hi> Verſ. 5. Though the proud man looketh too high, yet not high enough (you ſee) to take God into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, who ſhould be the principal object of it. There is none that ſtandeth at a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtance from God, both Actively and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively by way of ſin and puniſhment, than the proud perſon. Though the heart that's lifted up with pride beareth it ſelf ſo high, yet not high enough for ſuch a work as conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that is to be exerciſed in the higheſt matters: It's true both pride and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are of an aſpiring nature, and yet you can

'Tis the humble that God hath promiſed to dwell with, and teach; The reſt will not be taught, but ſay to the Almighty, <hi>depart from us, we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways, Job,</hi> 21.14. It's a deep ſence of emptineſs and thirſt after hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that makes way for conſideration: but they that ae full and happy in their own account, have no need of it, nor will be brought to conſider that they are <hi>poor and miſerable, and blind and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Rev.</hi> 3.17.

                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If you would taſt the pleaſure, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the great profit that conſideration would be ſure to bring along with it, ſet your ſelf in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:134641:116"/>good earneſt againſt a fickle, ſlothful ſpirit; I put theſe both together, becauſe <hi>I</hi> would not multiply particulars too far. It is the natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of man's Soul ſince it hath forſaken God, either to ſit ſtill and pine away in ſloth and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or elſe to wander up and down from one variety to another; both theſe extreams are too incident to the perverted nature of man, &amp; ſtand in very great oppoſition to the duty of Conſideration: our corrupted minds are very prone, either to ſleep ſecurely, or elſe to dream and wander about; either to be altogether idle, or buſie to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They are both Feaveriſh Diſtempers of the Soul, only one is the hot, and the other is the cold Fit; but they are both far enough from that ſound and even Conſtitution, wherein the health of the Soul doth conſiſt. The great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of conſideration lies in the averſneſs of our hearts to any fixed, ſerious thoughts of any thing, much more of God and the life to come, and matiers of that nature: The mind is of a wandring nature, and quickly weary of continued, perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, orderly thoughts of any thing: but yet thoſe that have overcome that fickleneſs of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mind as to other things, yet are backward enough to think with pertinency, life and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon ſpiritual and eternal things; It's eaſie to let the mind wander from one object to another, and very ſuitable to the fickle, mutable nature of man, that having left God, is become moſt unlike him. This is the temper of the greateſt part of the world; whoſe minds are become like a quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy or wanton ſtomack, that muſt taſte of this and that, &amp; the other diſh and cannot keep to any one,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:134641:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo their minds and affections are now after this thing, preſently after another; and are more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable than the wind or weather. Firſt, They are ſick for this or that beloved Object, and then by and by they are ſick of it, juſt now they are ſick for the thought and deſire of ſuch a thing; and preſently they are as ſick of the enjoyment of it, and quickly forget it. Hence it is that the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That man walketh in a vain ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and diſquieteth himſelf in vain, Pſal.</hi> 39.6. How can that man conſider any thing as he ought, or look beyond the Face and Appearance of any thing, that diſtracts himſelf with ſuch variety of thoughts, ſuch multiplicity of Objects that have not any any affinity with each other? <hi>The Eyes of a Fool,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, are in the ends of the earth, Prov.</hi> 17.24. (that is) upon every impertinent, idle object that concerns him not. It would very much diſpoſe our minds to that conſideration, I am ſpeaking of, to make the mind attend and keep cloſe to the duties that concern us, and the work that we are about: The more we give it a liberty to fly about every where, and to think of matters that concern it not; the more unfit will it be to be confined to any ſerious conſideration of Heavenly things And as a roving, wandring mind is very unmeet for conſideration, ſo is a ſlothful, lazy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that will not be at any pains in thinking, though of the greateſt matters in the world: That, when you would bring it on to conſideration, draws back, and cries <hi>there is a Lion in the way, Prov.</hi> 26.13. and is diſcouraged at every difficulty.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As you muſt avoid all that will either hinder or diſcourage the work of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; ſo you muſt do all that will promote and further it: As</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It will much conduce to the ſucceſsful performance of this duty, to be skilful in it. Now this skilfulneſs lies in theſe two things. (1) That your mind be truly convinc'd that God is the <hi>ſummum bonum.</hi> (1.) The chiefeſt good, and that your happineſs conſiſts in likeneſs to, and communion with him; and that you have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at hand to encreaſe this conviction, and to advance it to a higher degree by a quiet daily conſideration of them. (2.) That you know how to move upon your own affections, that they may be anſwerable to this conviction; I mean that you be skill'd to excite love to God, deſire after him, joy and delight in him, hope towards him, and the reſt of the mixt and more compounded affections of thankfulnefs to him, repentance for ſins committed againſt him; and that by ſuch Rhetorick and Perſwaſions that moſt prevail with him: and to this end it is neceſſary, that your memory, if not your heart, be ſtored with matter fit to work upon mind and heart, collected out of the Word and Providence of God, and from the daily obſervation of your own temper and inclinations; and that you can cloth it with expreſſions that work beſt upon your own Genius and Diſpoſition. That matter
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:134641:119"/>and way of preſſing it upon your mind and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is beſt to you which prevaileth moſt with them; and which will vary according to mens different complexions, education, ſociety, ſtudies and other circumſtances, which make a man lie open to this or that way of arguing more than any other; and more eaſie it may be to be wrought upon by a more probable argument, than others by a plain demonſtration. Such a Scheme of Rhetorick will ſtir this mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that will not move anothers: and the phraſe and manner of expreſſion will ſet one man on fire, that will not warm another; ſo that it is no ſmall ſtep to the ſucceſs of your meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be well verſed in your own temper and conſtitution, and to handle your ſelf according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when you come to treat by way of Soliloquy with your own Soul. Moreover, the main ſtick to ſome mens proficiency lies more in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, than in their affections: In others the obſtruction is moſt in their affections; for ſome are more eaſily conquered by rational argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that convince and ſatisfie the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; others by ſuch as work more upon the affections.</p>
               <p>The more you have of this skill to diſcern the moſt ſuitable method to deal with your ſelf, and what are the fitteſt applications; the more you are like to profit in, and by conſideration. Your reproofs, admonitions, and encouragements are the more likely to do their work when they are ſuitably applied, and hit you in the right Vein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another help to conſideration will be to charge it upon your ſelf as a duty of flat neceſſity: why is it that men that make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:134641:119"/>of prayer, yet make none at all of this duty of conſideration, though this be of as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity as the other? And prayer is like to turn into a meer form, and prove ineffectual without Meditation: For what can you imagine can be the reaſon, but that they take the one to be their duty, and not the other, when as God hath enjoyned the one as peremptorily as the other? And ſome ſet time ſhould be ſet apart daily for the one as well as for the other. It's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation that inſpires life into Prayer, hearing the Word, and all other duties. And conſideration, as well as prayer, muſt help you to profit by the providences of God towards you. For God will have man to have a ſubordinate hand in his own proficiency and ſalvation; and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the leading Act whereby man is inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to his own happineſs. It could not be, that this duty ſhould be ſo generally neglected and performed by ſo few, excepting by the By, unleſs it were generally thought to be no duty: men that have any Conſcience dare not live in the conſtant neglect of a known duty but they will be worried by their Conſcience, which will frequently twit them with their neglect. And they will perform it in a dead and cuſtomary manner rather than not at all, and ſo be feared to undergo the laſhes of their own guilty minds that will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſcourge them; well, whether you will charge it upon your ſelves as a duty of abſolute &amp; indiſpenſible neceſſity or no; ſo it is, duty will be duty, think how you will; and your ſlight and careleſs thoughts, will not make the Law of God of none effect. You have no ſmall obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to this duty, whether you will take notice
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:134641:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>of it, yea or not. If you neglect this duty; and have any Spark of true grace in your ſouls, any ſincere love to God and faith in his Son, you will quickly perceive the want of this duty in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition of your ſoul; your grace will quickly wither, and look with a famiſhed, pined complexion, and prayer and all other duty will ſtarve into a meer form, want thoſe holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are the very life and ſoul of them; and if you have no grace in ſincerity, none you are like to have, till you are brought to impartial, ſerious conſideration. Is it not better therefore to know your duty, and the great neceſſity of it, and bleſs God, that you are not kept in the dark, as many others are, that know of what moment it is, and periſh for want of it? If it were not a duty ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, then perhaps, the ignorance and neglect of it were not to be ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; but when the want of it will ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently deſtroy your ſouls, it's time to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, and to lay a further obligation on your ſelves by your own vow and promiſe, to be frequent in the practice of it. The duty is bound upon you already by a double neceſſity. (1.) By the neceſſity of a precept. (2.) By the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a means. God hath commanded it, and therefore if there were no other obligation, this were ſufficient to engage us to the performance. But if there were no command of God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the duty, yet ſince it is a means without which ſalvation is ſo impoſſible, and hath ſuch a mighty influence upon faith and all other grace, now it becomes doubly neceſſary to us. Let us then add a third neceſſity and lay a faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:134641:120"/>obligation upon our ſelves, by charging it upon our own ſouls, and obliging our ſelves by deliberate vow and reſolution to as Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious performance of it, as we do of Prayer, or any other duty that we dare not neglect; leſt we ſhould not be able to riſe or go to Bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear and the diſturbance of a guilty mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It will be a ſingular advantage to the work of Conſideration, (though more remote) to be temperate. Now Temperance is taken in the wideſt compaſs, for Moderation in the uſe of all Earthly Comforts; And in this larger extent it's taken, when <hi>Epictetus</hi> comprehends all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in thoſe two words; <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> or <hi>Abſtinence</hi> and <hi>Suſtinence,</hi>

               <p>The duty of Set and Solemn Contemplation requireth an illuminated, attentive mind, and a chearful heart, if it be performed with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Succeſs: But now, <hi>Whoredom and Wine, and new Wine take away the Heart, Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. They defraud this duty of that ſprightfulneſs, vigour and affection that it requires; and the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that's perpetually ſmoak'd with the Fumes that riſe from an over-charged Stomach, hath few <hi>Lucida intervalla,</hi> and is never perſpicacious, and ſit for ſuch contemplation. I deny not, but ſome degrees of this intemperance may conſiſt with this duty, and there may be ſome vacancy for a little dull exerciſe of this work: But if this diſeaſe be grown to any height or prevalency, the mind will be ſo liſtleſs, and the affections will be ſo earthly, that you may as well move a Block, as ſuch a ſurfeited ſoul to theſe Sublime and Raiſed Meditations. It will be like <hi>Anſelm's</hi> Bird with a heavy weight tyed to the Leg of it, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to fly and lift up it ſelf, or rather, it will have no diſpoſition to fly at all. O that all Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and Drunkards, and Perſons addicted to Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and Wantonneſs were well ſenſible of this, that are like to periſh for ever for want of that Conſideration that ſhould ſave them from deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Little do they think how they ſtarve in the midſt of ſuch Plenty, and how lean and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their Souls are, whilſt <hi>Their eyes ſtick out with fatneſs, Pſal.</hi> 73.7. Hence it is that your Gluttons and Wine-bibers, and the reſt of our Belly-Gods are ſo little acquainted with the life to come, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:134641:121"/>that they ſo little reliſh any diſcourſe with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others about Heavenly things; and that <hi>the Lord is not the Portion of their Cup, Pſal.</hi> 16.5. Hence it is that thoſe that are ſo familiar at the <hi>Cookes-Shop</hi> or <hi>Tavern,</hi> are ſo ſtrange to the place of Gods Reſidence, and inter-meddle not with the Heavenly Joys.</p>
               <p>But although it be this groſs Intemperance and Senſuality that is ſo Point Blank an enemy to Conſideration; yet I muſt ſay alſo that every degree of Intemperance doth much hinder the duty, and interrupt the joy and pleaſure thereof. For as it is a Sin againſt God, and much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him to withdraw and conceal himſelf, ſo it is a very malignant Enemy to the health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of Mind, that this duty calls for; for it weakens the Brain, and ſpoils the Memory, which ſhould ſupply matter to Meditation, and which is worſe, it brutifyes the heart. When the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of the Body is full, the Store-houſe of the Mind muſt needs be empty of every thing, but Fumes and Vapors, with which it is like enough to abound, and ſuch Notions as theſe miniſter to: No wonder if God be ſeldom in ſuch Mens Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories or Hearts. Therefore the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of the full-fed <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they were eſtranged from the Lord, <hi>According to their Paſture ſo were they filled, they were filled, and their heart was exalted, therefore have they forgotten me ſaith the Lord, Hoſ.</hi> 13.6. And why ſo; but becauſe ſuch Fulneſs and Intemperance will not let Men conſider, and without this God muſt needs be forgotten, becauſe he lies not open to the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye or ſence; it is the pure mind and heart
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:134641:122"/>that muſt ſee him both here and hereafter; and if theſe that are <hi>pure in heart are the bleſſed men, Mat.</hi> 5.8. Then they are curſed that are impure in mind and heart through Intemperance and other Luſts, becauſe they neither do now by conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor ſhall hereafter ſee God in the Beatifical Viſion; but Temperance diſpoſeth unto both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If you have any good Evidence that Chriſt is yours, and you are his, it will very much promote and ſweeten the work of Conſideration: I know that Conſideration is a neceſſary means to bring a man to Chriſt, and to turn the courſe of his affections and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; but yet ſo ſoon as a man feels this work done, that the world is reſolutely forſaken, and God is heartily choſen, the Soul will be then better diſpoſed to contemplate the glory of God and Heaven, to turn its thoughts upon the promiſes of the Goſpel, when it hath ſome intereſt and propriety in them; yea, and to think with pleaſure upon the threatnings of Gods Word, the nearneſs of death, the Worm of Conſcience that ſhall torment the wicked for ever and ever, after it hath made ſome good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and the bitterneſs of death is paſt, and the Sting pull'd out.</p>
               <p>It's no abſurdity nor contradiction that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> ſhould bring a man to Chriſt, and that the knowledge of a mans intereſt in Chriſt ſhould prompt him to, and further him in the work of <hi>Conſideration;</hi> that <hi>Conſideration</hi> ſhould beget Grace, and that Grace again ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Conſideration.</hi> This <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is frequent both in Nature and Grace: What more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:134641:122"/>to bring a man to Repentance, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the folly of his ways, the filthineſs and danger of his Sin, and the terrour and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Gods wrath? Who more like to be burthened with his tranſgreſſions, and feel the load of his iniquities, than he that frequently conſiders what miſery it brings upon him both here and hereafter; and how impoſſible it is to eſcape without Repentance? Who more likely to abhor himſelf, to be humbled and broken in heart, to confeſs his Sin with Shame, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt it (which are but the ſeveral parts of Repentance) than he that conſiders how he hath affronted God, perverted his Order, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Brethren, and wronged his own Soul, and diſparaged the very Reaſon that God hath given him, and laid the Foundation of Gods Eternal diſpleaſure, and his own everlaſting ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine? You ſee <hi>Conſideration,</hi> when it is of ſuch particulars, is the ready way to bring a Sinner to Repentance. And on the other ſide, who ſo like to find joy and pleaſure in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven, and the joys thereof, in the poſſeſſion it ſelf, and the promiſe that gives Right and Title to it, than he that hath ſome good hope through Grace that he ſhall enjoy it: So that you ſee of what uſe <hi>Conſideration</hi> is both before and after Converſion; but yet as before Regeneration there may be in the heart of a Sinner that love which worketh by deſire, though not that which worketh by complacency to Heaven and heavenly things; ſo before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there may be that Conſideration that is forced and conſtrained, but after Converſion
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:134641:123"/>it's like to be more ſweet and pleaſant, and to bring in greater profit and advantage. O could you but look upon God as your reconciled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt, and one that is at peace with you, how would this help up your thoughts Heavenward, and ſweeten your Meditations of the life and happineſs to come? you would not need then ſo much to force and ſpur up your mind to ſuch comfortable thoughts; at leaſt ſometimes it will be getting up of its own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary accord upon Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to view the promiſed Land; he that hopes to be one of the Inhabitants of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> will at leaſt ſometimes walk about <hi>Sion,</hi> and go round her, and tell the Towers thereof: And mark well her Bulwarks, and view and conſider her ſtately Manſions and Palaces, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 48.12, 13. what an encouragement will you have to look up and behold the glory and perfection of the Divine Nature, when you can ſay, <hi>This is my Father, and theſe Attributes I have an Intereſt in?</hi> But yet I muſt needs confeſs, that even after Converſion there will be oft-times much back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and reluctancy to this ſpiritual and heavenly Duty; and you will need to quicken up your ſelves, and chide your backward hearts, that they ſhould be ſo ſtrange to the place where their Treaſure is laid up: But yet it will not be ſo hard to bring your heart to ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as it was, when you were without hope, and without God in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It will further the work of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to lay Temporal things in the balance with Eternal things, and to make advantage of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:134641:123"/>every Object that's preſented to our Senſes, to make the conſideration of the higheſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things more warm and piercing: You may very well and rationaily conclude, that if the glory of Earth be ſo great as to dazle the eyes of ſome beholders, and ſtrongly to enamour their affections, that the glory of Heaven doth far out-ſhine it. He hath reſerved joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs indeed for that place and ſtate, if there be ſo much to be found in this ſinning imperfect ſtate here on Earth; for all Earthly things ſerve but to the example and ſhadow of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. If the beauty of the body be ſo taking, that men and women often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dote upon it, what is the beauty of the Soul do you think? and if it were to be ſeen with bodily eyes, how much would it raviſh and amaze the beholders? If the pleaſure of the Senſes be ſo ſweet and delicious that men will buy them at the deareſt rate; how ſweet muſt the pleaſures of the Soul needs be, when there is ſo vaſt a difference between the Soul and Body that are the ſubjects of theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>As there is an unſpeakable diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Spirit and a Body, ſo there muſt needs be as wide a diſproportion between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the one, and the delights of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For I ſuppoſe none can be ſo abſurd as to think, that the ſtate to come ſhall be no better than this preſent ſtate, and that mens Bodies are as much worth as their Souls; and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is the place of his glorious Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Palace, is no more adorned than the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:134641:124"/>Earth: None can be ſo void of reaſon to think, that God beſtows as much upon his Rational Creatures, whilſt they are in a ſtate of Tryal and Probation, as when they are come to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and are actually choſen to be Citizens of the Heavenly Corporation, where they ſhall live for ever: How can the joy of Seed-time be comparable to the joy of Harveſt? And how can this viſible Sun rejoyce the Creatures that it ſhines upon, ſo much as the Face of God will rejoyce thoſe that behold it? You may well therefore riſe up in your Meditations from any perfection that you behold on Earth, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire thoſe perfections that are unſeen: They are the greateſt that lye not open to the bodily eye, nor can be enjoyed by any Corporeal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Organ: ſo that when you walk abroad, and look upon the glory of the viſible Heaven and Earth, you may much more admire the ſplendour and excellency of the inviſible Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and conſequently of all thoſe things that lead thither: God that made all things, made thoſe viſible things, that they might be ſome advantage to the Underſtanding of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible; and that they might lead up our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and affections to him that cannot be immediately ſeen without the help of ſuch a Glaſs. God is infinitely exalted above our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, neither are we capable of having any direct and proper Conceptions of the ſtate and life to come; and therefore the glory of Heaven is ſet forth to us in the Word of God, by ſuch things as ſeem glorious to our Senſes: The Streets of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> or Heaven,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:134641:124"/>are ſaid to be paved with Gold, and the Gates to conſiſt of Pearl and precious Stones; and the pleaſures of that ſtate are ſet forth by a Feaſt, becauſe theſe are ſo pleaſing to our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Now though we muſt not underſtand theſe things in a proper litteral ſenſe, yet we are hence inſtructed, that the happineſs is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, and ſuch as cannot be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by us, but by ſuch helps as theſe: So that we may well argue from any pleaſures or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency here on Earth, to the excellency and pleaſure of that ſtate, and make this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all ſenſible comforts, to make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things ſpiritual more lively and affecting. As therefore you may collect the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable torment and miſery of the Damned, by the preſſures and calamities that we feel here on Earth; and Hell is uſually ſet forth by Fire and Darkneſs, and a Worm continually feeding upon the Conſcience, which are things obvious to our Senſes: ſo likewiſe is the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and dignity of the Saints ſet forth by a Crown, and Scepter, and Kings, things moſt glorious here on Earth: And this uſe we ſhould wiſely make of theſe things to put life into our Meditations, which otherwiſe would little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Laſtly you muſt diligently read and hear the Word of God, peruſe the labours of thoſe that are moſt skilful in the expoſition and application thereof. If you ask me who they are; I anſwer, uſe your beſt endeavours to know, and make the moſt impartial enquiry. The frequent caſting your eye upon, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:134641:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>your ear to ſuch matters, is the way to get good furniture into your memory and heart, which will ever and anon creep into your thoughts, and even invite and conſtrain you to dwell with more intentneſs and affection on them: But you when you are reading, and hearing theſe things that muſt be the Subject of your Meditations, and ſowing the Seed of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration, you muſt drive away the Birds of Prey that would devoure the Seed that you have ſown, I mean all diſturbing worldly thoughts, and keep your mind as much retired from all other things as you are able, that it may be free and open to the impreſſions of the Word and Spirit; thoſe eſpecially that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed for Meditation muſt take this courſe, for it is moſt like to proſper, ſince it hath not only Precept, but Reaſon to enforce it. They muſt never expect to have their Souls byaſſed to, and fitted for this Duty, that neglect theſe means which the Wiſdom of God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and let their thoughts ſcamble about, and imploy their eyes and ears about any petty matters, rather than in the reading and hearing of Gods Word, and ſuch explications of it as are likelieſt to bring it to the mind and heart; eſpecially read and hear thoſe paſſages of truth (that Life and Salvation moſt depends on) moſt frequently, and get them as faſt into your mind as you are able, and a right underſtanding of the very tenour and chief ſcope of the Goſpel, which is to bring men to the ſight of their ſins, and by that to come to Chriſt as his tractable Diſciples, and by Faith in Chriſt to Salvation;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:134641:125"/>which deſign that it might bring to paſs, it ſets the higheſt motives and encouragement before us, and gives us the greateſt helps: But above all parts of Scripture, the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently read, will promote you in the work of conſideration, and teach you h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> expreſſeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every Pſalm. There you may ſee how he ſets upon God ſometimes, ſometimes ſtirs up his own Soul, confers with God, communes with his own heart, that he might kindle the Fire of Gods Love in his heart, which is the principal deſign of conſideration; for whether he expreſs ſorrow and contrition for his ſin, it is but that he may ſtir up hatred in his Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, which is the great impediment to the Love of God: Or if he expreſs and utter his complaints of the vanity of the World, and the miſeries of this life, all is to quicken up his deſires after the true happineſs of his Soul; and you know love is intrinſecal and eſſential to deſire; if he enlarge, as he doth frequently in the praiſes of the Lord, and diſplay his glory, and muſter up his perfections, and call Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, and all the Inhabitants of them, and all the Iſlands and Continents of the World, and bring in their teſtimony to him; and to make his Name glorious, if he ſummon every living thing that hath breath to praiſe the Lord, it is that he may advance the eſteem and encreaſe the love of God in his own heart, and the hearts of others; and therefore from this Book you may fetch matter enough, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for conſideration to make uſe of for the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:134641:126"/>kindling of this and all other holy and devout affections; yea the very out-ſide, I mean the phraſe and expreſſion of the Pſalms is ſuch, as hath a powerful Rhetorick with it to ſet the heart on fire with the love of God; no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative and devout Chriſtian but hath had very familiar acquaintance with this Book. I have told you the flat neceſſity of conſideration, if ever a man be brought to his right mind, yea and how neceſſary it is to preſerve you in the love and fear of God after you have believed; if therefore you are convinced that is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without which you can never get the cure of your deadly diſtempers, then you will make Conſcience of the means whereby you may be brought to conſideration: The heart is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to delight in God, and love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and to uſe the world as if he us'd it not, its conſideration that muſt change it; the heart is naturally dead to ſpiritual things, it's Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that muſt enliven it, and make it ſtir; the heart is prone to wander from God, it's Conſideration that muſt bring it home; the heart is full of blindneſs and obduracy, it's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that muſt enlighten and ſoften it: If therefore you would not periſh in blindneſs and obduracy, and wander from God without hopes of recovery, and loſe the Pearl of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite price (which who ſo is wiſe will ſell all that he hath to buy and purchaſe) then uſe the means that muſt bring you to Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt great Object of your Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſhould be God, and the Relation you ſtand in to him, and his glorious Perfections: It's worth thy while to conſider daily that he made thee out of nothing; and when there are four diſtinct Ranks of Creatures <hi>(viz.)</hi> Things that have meer being without life: 2. Things that have being and life, ſuch as are all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, Trees, and Flowers: 3. Such as have being, life, and ſenſe, ſuch as are Brutes, and other ſenſitive Creatures: 4. Such as have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life, ſenſe, and reaſon; when there are theſe four Species and Orders of Creatures, he hath placed thee in the higheſt form, and hath made the other three Ranks for thy uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and as he hath made thee ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo thou haſt thy ſupportation and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance wholly from him, and he is training thee up in the world for his immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and for thoſe raviſhing delights that are to be enjoyed in the Beatifical Viſion. Canſt thou poſſibly conſider the perfection of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thy relation to him as his Creature, from whom all that thou haſt or doeſt expect muſt be fetched, thine hourly dependance on him, his Authority over thee, his right and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:134641:127"/>in thee, his bounty towards thee, and not fall down before him, and lift up thy heart to him with reverence; nor feel the fire kindle in thy heart, and thy ſelf willing to be offered up as a whole Burnt-offering in that fire? To of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up Body and Soul, with all their ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and actions, as a living Sacrifice to him, is but thy reaſonable ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. As it is his end why he made thee, ſo it ſhould be thy end to have his works continually in thine eye, his Word ever in thine heart, and his praiſes everlaſtingly in thy mouth: This was the reſolution of <hi>David,</hi> and ſhould be thine; <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as long as I live, I will ſing praiſes to my God whilſt I have my being: My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 104.33, 34. Conſider that he hath infinite wiſdom, and therefore is fit to rule thee, and all the world; he hath infinite power, and therefore its ſtark madneſs for ſuch a Worm to reſiſt him; one word of his mouth will undo the Body and Soul for ever, one angry frown of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance will make thee wither, and turn that moving body of thine into a dead and lifeleſs Clod, yea and ſend thy Soul into eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Didſt thou but conſider the holineſs of his Nature, and how much he abhorreth all ſin and wickedneſs, wouldſt thou dare to commit it with ſo much boldneſs? Didſt thou but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a piercing eye he hath, to whom the darkneſs and the light are both alike, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.12. wouldſt thou think to cover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal thy Sins from him, or uſe craft and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:134641:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>to blind his eyes? Thou doſt not conſider what he is whilſt thou uſeſt ſuch ſilly ſhifts as theſe are; they do but provoke a wiſe man that hath but a Beam of Gods infinite wiſdom, how much more are they like to provoke him? There's nothing like ingenuity and plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and humble confeſſing of thy Sin when thou haſt to do with him; Conſideration of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Purity and Juſtice would be a very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al defence againſt all unjuſt and unrighteous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices: If thou doſt but conſider what antipathy there is in Sin to the Divine Nature, and what an affront it is to the Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, it would not go down ſo eaſily, nor be ſuch a ſweet morſel to thee: When men begin to take off the eye of their Conſideration from God, then they begin to walk in darkneſs, and know not at what they ſtumble. What makes men ſo vain and wicked in their imaginations and practices, but becauſe God is not in all their thoughts by Conſideration? What makes the ungodly to prefer the pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a ſeaſon, but becauſe they do not eye and conſider the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? What makes men either to neglect to come to God by prayer, or to put up faint and cold ſupplications to him, but that they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not that he is, and that he is a rewarder of all them that diligently ſeek him: Thou wouldſt not murmur and repine at any of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences towards thee, if thou didſt but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Equity, Wiſdom and Mercy there is in all his dealings towards thee, thou wouldſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Croſs, and deſpiſe the ſhame, if thou
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:134641:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>didſt but ſeriouſly conſider the joys that are ſet before thee; thou wouldſt be ſtedfaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, if thou didſt but conſider thy labour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in vain in the Lord. I adviſe thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conſider and think more frequently what an impartial righteous Judge thou haſt to do with in thy actions, and how dear thou ſhalt pay for thy Sin one of theſe days if thou wilt commit it, and this would ſpur thee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to thy duty when thou wouldſt neglect it, and keep thee backward from Sinful practice when thou wouldſt commit it. Let my counſel therefore be acceptable to thee, have God more frequently in thy Meditations, conſider that he ſeeth and knoweth thy ways, that he abhorreth all wickedneſs both of heart and life, that he is the Governour of the World, to whom all theſe things are as nothing, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the Beings of Heaven and Earth, that hath the Winds and the Sea, and Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in the Chain of his Providence, that was from all Eternity, and is the ſame for ever and ever; but thou art of yeſterday, and knoweſt nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 8.9. Thou mayſt reſiſt the will of his Command and Precept, becauſe it is to try thee, but thou canſt not withſtand the will of his purpoſe, what he doth will peremptorily ſhall come to paſs; <hi>The Counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all Generations,</hi> Pſa. 33.11. If thou loveſt thy own Soul, let God be continually before thy eyes; it is becauſe thou knoweſt him not that thou art ſo unlike him; it is becauſe thou art not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:134641:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>acquainted with him, that thy heart is ſo void of love to him, it is becauſe thou underſtandeſt him not, that thou doſt ſo little fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him: And why haſt thou ſo little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding of him, but becauſe thou conſidereſt him not? Didſt thou but well conſider his Omnipotency, thou wouldſt fear him more than all the world beſide? Didſt thou but conſider his Veracity, thou wouldſt take his word for the greateſt ſecurity, and give more credit to it, than if thou hadſt the word and Oath of the moſt truſty and ſufficient men; thou wouldſt certainly believe the threatnings thereof, and foreſee the accompliſhment of the promiſes thereof, as if they were already made good, and ſteer thy life according to the moſt wiſe and excellent precepts thereof. Conſider but his faithfulneſs, and thou wilt ſee no reaſon to diſtruſt him: They that know thy Name (ſaith the Prophet <hi>David</hi>) will truſt in thee, for thou Lord haſt never forſaken thoſe that truſt in thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. Thou wouldſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy life and all thy comforts upon his Word; come what will thou wouldſt truſt in the Lord, and do good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. And whilſt thou art intent upon thy duty wouldſt not fear, though men and Devils ſhould combine againſt thee; and the more experience thou haſt, the more thou wouldſt be confident, and ſay, <hi>It's better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in man; It's better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes, Pſal.</hi> 118.8, 9. Do but conſider that he is a Spirit, and thou wilt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor a meer bodily ſervice, and tremble to let
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:134641:129"/>thy lips go when thy heart imagineth deceit, and is not imployed in his worſhip, and thou wouldeſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, <hi>John</hi> 4.23, 24. Therefore men worſhip him they know not how, nor care not in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe they worſhip they know not what, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. Men would not dare to offer up to him the Sacrifice of fools, if they did but conſider with whom they have to do, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they come with dead hearts before the living God. This is the firſt thing that I recommend to your Conſideration, as being moſt worthy of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, with application to your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next thing that is worthy of your ſerious thoughts, and daily conſideration, is wherefore you were born into the world. Can any man that hath not laid his reaſoning Faculty quite aſleep, think that he was made to live forty or threeſcore years in the world, and then to die like a Brute, and there's an end of the Story: He that will take the pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and make uſe of the light that's offered to him, both in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſhall find that Man was made for ſomething elſe, and that he is worſe than a Brute that looks no higher. I take it for granted, that no man can think that ſuch a Noble Creature as Man is, was made by chance by a happy conjuncture of a few fortuitous Atoms that joſtled together, and met at laſt into ſuch an orderly ſhape, as if all had been contrived with the greateſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom imaginable: Nor do I think that any one
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:134641:129"/>that hath not quite loſt his underſtanding, can imagine that he grew out of the Earth as Graſs or Trees, much leſs will he ſay that there was no firſt Man, but that there hath been a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Reaſonable Creatures from Eternal Ages: If therefore he could not poſſibly come into the world any of theſe ways, then he muſt be made by a Wiſdom far higher than his own, and that can be none but God. Theſe things being ſuppoſed, can any man in his wits think that God made the higheſt and beſt of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here on Earth with ſuch Faculties, and endued him with underſtanding, and put ſuch deſires into him, that nothing in this world can ſatisfie; to live a little while below, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf, and to rule and domineer over the other Creatures, and devour them, and live as he liſt; and then after he is dead, to be had no more in remembrance? Surely he might have plaid at ſuch a Game as this without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he might have ſatisfied his luſts, and took his eaſe, and never have miſſed this Faculty that doth but chaſtiſe him for his brutiſhneſs, and help to make him more miſerable than thoſe that want it. It is moſt certain that God hath deſign'd him for a higher end, even for the ſervice of himſelf, &amp; an Eternal life with him hereafter. It's moſt worthy of your ſerious conſideration, that you may be fully ſatisfied, and know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have done this work: If indeed you can think after you have well conſidered that its no matter how a man lives, ſo he can but enjoy a little mirth and laughter in the world, then you may caſt off all other care if you will, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:134641:130"/>ſtudy how to live merrily, and Crown your ſelves with Roſe-buds before they be withered: If any man can conſider, and reaſon impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and think it is the wiſeſt way to enjoy the pleaſures of Meat and Drink, and Luſt and Eaſe, he ſhall have my conſent to take his courſe. Who would envy a man that was made to live above the Stars, and to out-ſhine the Sun in all its glory, that will chuſe rather to go to Graſs, and to feed with his Cattel? All the difference is, that he hath a little more Wit than a Cow or a Horſe, and therefore can do more miſchief than one of them; but his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is but brutiſh, and of no higher a ſtamp than theirs. O conſider, that though you may ſtifle your Reaſon, and ſmother the Light that teacheth you to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent evil world, you ſhall not always prevail againſt it; if you will not let it ſpeak now, it will ſpeak whether you will or no, and cry out bitterly againſt you hereafter: Conſideration would roundly and quickly tell you, that you were made to know, love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God that made you for a while in this world, and then be removed to the ſight and enjoyment of himſelf; other things ſublunary were made for the ſervice of Man, but Man for Gods immediate ſervice; his very Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the make and frame of all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties proclaim thus much: What ſhould he do with an Immortal Soul to walk up and down the world with, if he were not to live in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world? Why ſhould he be put to School among the viſible Creatures, and be under the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:134641:130"/>diſcipline and inſtructions of his Maker day and night, which other Creatures are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of, if he were not training him up for a higher State? Alas God delighteth not in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, nor in making this life a burden to us, it is that he might prove us, and try us, and wean us from things temporary, and awaken us to ſeek out for that happineſs that indeed we were made for: <hi>Job</hi> therefore takes it for a high favour to be thus ſeverely educated; <hi>What is Man that thou ſhould'ſt magnifie him,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or the Son of Man that thou ſhould'ſt ſet thy heart upon him; and that thou ſhould'ſt viſit him every morning, and try him every moment?</hi> If this were not in order to a future good, why ſhould he not complain rather that God hath made him in a worſe condition than the Beaſts? they enjoy pleaſure without any remorſe, and lay them down in their Dens, and are ſecure; but Man vexeth himſelf with a thouſand cares, and frighteth himſelf with as many fears, and ſeeth evil before it comes, and feeleth it after its paſt and gone, which Brutes cannot do: But as Earthly Parents, if they are wiſe, will train up their Children with more ſeverity than they will their ſervants, and others that they bear not ſuch a reſpect to: ſo the moſt wiſe and gracious God uſeth a more ſevere Diſcipline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, whom he intendeth to a greater honour, than towards the reſt of his Creatures; he letteth them take their courſe whilſt he tyes Fetters and Bands upon men, and tyeth them by his Laws to Noble and Worthy actions, and ſcourgeth them with his Rod when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:134641:131"/>and wander from the way of life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as if he would even conſtrain them to be happy. O why do we no more purſue our own happineſs, when God doth even entreat us, and ſpur us on by ſo many encouragements, and hath made us for this very work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Shall God be more ſolicitous for our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare than we are for our own? O poor deluded ſinner! thou miſtakeſt thy work and buſineſs, and where thy happineſs lies, when thou art pleaſing thy fleſh, and greedily hunting after the pleaſures thereof: Thou thinkeſt that fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſure, or worldly gain is godlineſs, but it will prove quite contrary in the end; and thou wilt then know, when it is too late, that godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the greateſt pleaſure and gain: I know it's natural to thee to thirſt after happineſs; ſeek it then in the way that God hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or thou ſhalt never purchaſe thy deſire, though thou pine away thy ſelf from day to day with earneſt deſires and endeavours after it: Thou wert made for God, and thy Soul will be reſtleſs till it return to him; Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would convince thee that thus it is; think then more frequently what is that work thou wert made for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The next thing worth your moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration is, how well you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the end of your Creation. You ſee what a wiſe, juſt, holy and impartial God you have to do with, and that you are his Creatures and wherefore he hath made you, and endued you with ſuch Faculties, and given you ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious helps and encouragements: Now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:134641:131"/>how well you have uſed them, how you have improved your ſeveral Talents, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your Maker, and kept the Statutes and Judgments he hath given you: Have you had your heart in Heaven, or in Earth, ever ſince you came hither? Have you lived to God, or without God in the world? Have you lived in the love and praiſes of your Maker, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to his Laws? or have you not rather extinguiſhed all love of God in your hearts, and violated all his righteous Laws, and preferred the wiſdom of the Fleſh before the wiſdom of the Spirit, and ſet your ſelves to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Government? Though it may be you have not ſinned againſt him on ſet purpoſe, and directly oppoſed him, yet have you not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſult his will, and when you have known your duty in many particulars, have you not refuſed to obey? Let your own Conſciences be the Judge: Have you kept the fear of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before your eyes? Hath no corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication proceeded out of your mouth? Have no idle, blaſphemous, wicked thoughts crept into your hearts? Have you been juſt and righteous in all your dealings towards God and Men? Have you ſtood up for the honour of God againſt all his Enemies, and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Sin, and done all your works with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Gods glory? or have you not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked that, and minded your own worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and cheriſhed revengeful, proud, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thoughts in your own hearts, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced Sin in others? at leaſt, have you not been ſilent when Gods Name hath been lightly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:134641:132"/>uſed in every trivial matter, and his Sabbaths profan'd, and his Word derided? There's none of us but muſt confeſs we have neglected this great work too much at the beſt; how much more at the worſt? Our Hereditary Corruption was enough to make us odious in the pure Eyes of God for ever; what then ſhall we plead for our Actual Sins, which are multiplied to ſuch a number, that we cannot reckon them up? So that there is no man that is not liable to the Wrath of God, and the Condemning Sentence of his Law. Conſider whether you have not been treaſuring up Wrath all your days, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying your ſelves, and preferring Dung and Droſs before him. Did he make thee to affront and diſhonour him, and prefer a trifle before him? Did he make thee to ſcrape after the world, to make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof? Bethink thy ſelf, and conſider whether thou haſt diſcharged thy Duty, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Ends of thy Creation, and done all to the glory of God, and you will ſee Cauſe enough to abhor your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Being thus obnoxious to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and liable to Death and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſider in the fourth place, whether you are ſenſible of your Sin and Miſery, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have accepted the grace which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel offers to you? There's no remedy but you muſt periſh for ever, and have the Judgment of Everlaſting Condemnation, if <hi>Conſideration</hi> do not bring you to Repentance, and wound your hearts with the bitter ſenſe and feeling of your Sin.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:134641:132"/>
                  <p>O conſider that it was the mere mercy of God that any ſuch terms were offered to you! he might have left you as he did the fallen Angels, and therefore if now you ſhall ſlight a pardon, and refuſe to lay your ſin to heart, and to be humbled and broken for it, and to come to Chriſt with a loving and thankful heart, that he would cleanſe and purifie you by his Word and Spirit; your caſe &amp; condition will be the more doleful, &amp; your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Great Day will be more Intolerable: I know you have verbally Renounced the World, the Devil and the Fleſh, in your Baptiſmal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but have you Really and Unfeignedly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them in heart and life? Are you Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that nothing can waſh away the ſtain of any the leaſt of your Sins, but the Blood of Chriſt, much leſs wipe away the Sins of your whole Life? Have you throughly conſidered the neceſſity of his Blood to procure your Pardon? the neceſſity of his Spirit to Sanctifie you? And that there is no Name under Heaven by which you can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but his? but if you be ſuch that loath your ſelves for all former Sins, and are weary of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſinful Nature, and Chriſt be the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among ten Thouſand to your Soul; then though you have ſo much croſſed the end of your Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and committed ſo much Sin, it ſhall not be charged on you, the Blood of Chriſt will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cleanſe you from all your Sin; If this faith be not yet wrought in you, conſideration muſt open and ſoften your Heart, and make way for it. If you did but frequently conſider, what privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they are forthwith admitted to, that do believe; and what a fearful looking for of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:134641:133"/>there remaineth for unbelievers, you would haſten to make your eſcape, from the Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Wind and Tempeſt. Suppoſe that ſome Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſtemper had ſeized on you, (and this will certainly be your caſe ere long) do but a little conſider what the priviledges of a believer will be worth to you then; how ſweet the promiſe of forgiveneſs by Chriſt will be to your taſt? <hi>Yea ſweeter than the Honey to your throat. Pſal.</hi> 119.103. Do but let your thoughts run upon this Subject, and tell you, How happy you would count your ſelf if you were united to Chriſt and a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his body, reconciled to God, and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, adopted into his family, and received into his eſpecial protection: what would you give then to be acquitted from all your former ſins, to have the ſting of Death pull'd out; to land ſafe at your deſired Harbour, to dye in the Lord, and to have a Convoy of bleſſed Angels to carry your ſoul to endleſs Joy? ſay what you would give then to be ſecured from the ſenſible ſears of Hell, and Death, and to lie down in the Grave in Peace and Safety; and to have nothing then to make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid? Why if you are a Penitent Believer, and belong to Chriſt, there will be comfort for you in the Hour, when all the World ſhall ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you. <hi>Whoſo hearkeneth unto me ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from fear of evil. Prov.</hi> 1.33. When natural ſtrength will be ſure to fail you, and your Soul is going out from your Body, where it hath ſo long dwelt, and worldly friends cannot help you, it will be worth a world to be numbred among the Saints, and to have your portion with the Moſt-High; conſideration will
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:134641:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>help you to know all this, and whether you are weary of your ſin, and have fled to Chriſt as your only Sanctuary, and are heartily deſirous that he ſhould ſave you from the Power of it; yea it would help you to all this, and make you ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if yet you are not, and break your heart for all former unkindneſs to God, and Cruelty to your own Soul, and make Chriſt precious to you indeed, <hi>The full Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) loatheth the Honey-Comb, but to the Hungry Soul every bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing is Sweet:</hi> The Nature of man prompteh him in every ſtreight to caſt about with himſelf how he may get out: Did you feel to what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable danger, ſin hath brought you; I dare ſay you would not ſlight the remedy, nor deſpiſe the Salvation that Chriſt offereth to you; did you feel your ſoul in a ſinking condition by reaſon of your ſin, you would lay hold on Chriſt as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as a drowning man catch at a ſtick, or any thing that he thinks may ſave him: Thus it would be if ſin were a burthen to you. And how could you chuſe but feel it a burthen to you, if you did but apprehend the evil and danger of it? Now conſideration would clear this to your apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. How could you conſider in the midſt of ſuch helps, and not diſcern that by your Sin, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the higheſt Authority, tranſgreſs the moſt righteous Law, debauch and corrupt the beſt of his Creatures here on earth, and make him utterly unſerviceable to the uſes for which God made him; And trample Reaſon under your feet, and pervert Gods Eſtabliſhed order, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the world, and cruelly wound, vex and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet your own ſoul; And even dare and provoke
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:134641:134"/>God to bring upon you all the calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, both of this and the other life. And would not theſe particulars alone diſcover to you the evil and odiouſneſs of your Sin, and even compel you to hate it? And then when you are gotten thus far, and diſcern Sin to be your greateſt enemy, you would not ſtick at any terms to be rid of it. If you were once fully ſatisfied, that Sin is the fouleſt diſgrace and ſhame of a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a certain preparative to it's Eternal reproach, you would not live in peace with it; not lye down and riſe up quietly with ſuch a noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom diſeaſe upon you, that doth make God loath his own Creature, and will make you abhor and loath your ſelves, if ever you come to right and ſober uſe of your Reaſon; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9, and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. Make as light of it now as you pleaſe, whilſt reaſon is laid to ſleep, and Scripture is not regarded, and Conſcience is quite out faced; it ſhall not be always ſo: It is but the night time of this life at fartheſt, that your dream will laſt; and then Reaſon and Scripture and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will all ſet againſt you: <hi>Though you wink now and will not ſee, yet then you ſhall ſee and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. you may certainly fore-ſee without the Spirit of Propheſy, that thus it will be, if you believe the word of God, And as a truely penitent believer may ſay with David, <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake after thy likeneſs. Pſal.</hi> 17.15. So the deluded Sinner that dreams ſo merrily now, that Sin is but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of nothing whilſt he is commiting of it, ſhall be confounded, when he awakes after the Divels likeneſs, O if theſe things were ſoundly believed,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:134641:134"/>you would delay no longer, but forſake your Sin, and come to Chriſt as your only Saviour; and if any thing under God would bring you to ſuch a certain and undoubted belief, <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> would do the work: <hi>Conſider</hi> therefore whether it be thus with you, that Sin is your on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burthen, and Chriſt is your only eaſe; and if it be not ſo, <hi>conſider</hi> that it may be ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another thing which you ſhould ſet before your eye, and frequently <hi>conſider,</hi> is the vanity of all theſe things, which ſtand in competition with God for your affections; Do you not ſee what haſty and unſatisfying Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they are? I call them Pleaſures, becauſe Cuſtom hath prevail'd; the World calls them ſo, and the Fleſh calls them ſo, whoſe Pleaſures they are; for the Soul of Man, were it out of the Body, would not reliſh them. But though this be the ſtile of the World, it's pity that a man ſhould call any thing Pleaſure, that doth not laſt for ever: But call it what you will, I am ſure it's a grand miſtake, to count that a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that doth not gratifie the better part of a man, and a Sin to beſtow the leaſt meaſure of our love upon any thing that doth not promote the happineſs of our Souls. God hath put an aptitude into all things to further mans felicity, and hath commanded him to take them by the right Handle, &amp; make that uſe of them; &amp; when they are uſed ultimately for the pleaſure that's in them, and are not ſubordinate to a higher end, even the better ſerving of God, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our Souls, they are made our End, which ſhould be but Means, and ſet up inſtead
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:134641:135"/>of God, to ſupply his room, and to be to us what he alone ſhould be; and then no wonder if they prove to us meer vanity, that is, if they lye to us, and fruſtrate our expectations. All Creatures tell us a meer lye, when they make us any promiſe of happineſs and full contentment in the enjoyment of them; but the truth is, there's no Creature can be ſo impudent as to make us ſuch a promiſe; it is we that are too credulous and ſinfully prone to take every Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow for our happineſs, and to place our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon any thing here on Earth, rather than God. But where is the man that can boaſt that he hath found the deſire of his heart in any pleaſure here on Earth? The very fear of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is diſparagement enough to any worldly felicity. And ſince it may be truly ſaid of any thing that here we do poſſeſs, except it be the peace of a good Conſcience, and the ſpecial grace of God in Chriſt, it may be gone to morrow, and leave us; it is enough to ſet the heart of a conſidering man againſt all created comforts, and make him ſeek after ſomething that will never fail: Where is the man, or what is his name, that hath found the Treaſure of his Soul here on Earth? If they could help thee in all thy ſtreights, and ſtick to thee for ever, and never forſake thee, then ſomething might be plauſibly pretended why thou ſhould'ſt ſet thine affections on them. But if thou wilt ſuffer thy ſelf to conſider, thou wilt perceive <hi>Vanity</hi> to be written upon the back of every Creature (that is) as it is going from thee, though thou may'ſt poſſibly think that thou ſeeſt <hi>Pleaſure</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:134641:135"/>written upon the face of it, that is, as it is coming towards thee: If thou wilt not believe this now, thine experience ſhall ſhortly make it good, and condemn thee for a ſtark fool, in that thou haſt ſo much teaching, and yet would'ſt not learn; that thou had'ſt eyes, and could'ſt not ſee; and that thou waſt ſo oft forewarned of the vanity and deceitfulneſs of theſe Earthly pleaſures, and yet would'ſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: And yet I will confeſs, if the fault could then be mended, after Experience hath taught thee the vanity of them, and thou art going out of the world as a miſerable wretch, ready to be forſaken of the comforts which thou haſt inordinately loved; if then thou could'ſt recover thine affections, and bequeath thine heart to God, which the world did poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs all thy life time, then it would be ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of thy Sin and Folly. But as ſure as thou liveſt God will not take that heart at thy Death, which thou would'ſt not give him in thy Life, nor be put off with a Legacy when thou art dying and going out of the world, to whom thou would'ſt give nothing all thy life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. But yet if the Lord would accept ſuch an Offering from thee, that heart that hath been ſo commanded all thy life long by ſuch pleaſures as the world affords, will not be now at thine own command and diſpoſe: It will be hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the world when it is departing and leaving of it, and would ſtill live among theſe pleaſures if it could, and prefer them before E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life with God. But I beſeech thee to conſider, whether it be not perfect madneſs, to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:134641:136"/>ſuffer thine affections to be thus captivated, and bewitched with fading momentary delights. They are little to be envied, whoſe whole lives are but a Diverſion from one pleaſure to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But if any men on Earth are like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for ever, and loſe thoſe ſatisfying pleaſures at Gods right Hand for evermore, theſe are the men. It is not one of a thouſand that recovers of their Surfeit, when they come to be old, that have lived their younger years wholly addicted to their carnal brutiſh delights; and not a man that dies amidſt ſuch pleaſures, before his heart be weaned from them, but is like to feel more bitter torment, than ſuch as have lived all their life-time in poverty and little eaſe. Surely they that let out their hearts too freely to the things of this world, forget that there is ſuch a Text in the Word of God; <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.19. But that which makes ſome men that know this well enough to be miſtaken is, becauſe they read of ſeveral rich men in Scripture that have their hands full of theſe Earthly comforts, and ſee and hear of others that go to Heaven in the midſt of great Poſſeſſions; therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently conclude that they may enjoy them as well as others, and yet be in a ſafe condition; as if there were no difference between having and enjoying of them. Their hearts were far enough from their Poſſeſſions, as you might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have ſeen, if you had lived and converſed with them: Though they had a large portion of their comforts, a good meaſure of this Dung
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:134641:136"/>and Droſs, as the Apoſtle calls it, yet they ſpread it to the good increaſe of Religion and Piety where they had to do; they took little pleaſure in this Dunghil, neither did they ſpend their precious thoughts, and time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. But thy heart it may be is Wedded to theſe Carnal contentments and buried in this Dunghil: and thy ſweeteſt pleaſures come in this way, and <hi>when riches encreaſe thy heart is ſet upon them, Pſal.</hi> 62.10. Let me tell thee, that if ever Conſideration open thine eyes, thou wilt be as mad againſt theſe pleaſures, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou wert mad for them: And thou that do'ſt ſo induſtriouſly ſeek them with ſuch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtudy and endeavour, wilt then be ſick of them, <hi>nulla major voluptas quam voluptatis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtidium.</hi> No pleaſure like that of contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch tranſitory unmanly pleaſures as theſe are; if (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith) <hi>he is not worthy the name of a man, that would live a whole day in ſuch pleaſures;</hi> I am ſure he is not worthy the name of a Chriſtian that can live his whole life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and prefer the pleaſures of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before the feaſting of his Soul. It's the want of ſerious Conſideration, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that makes ſo many loſe the Joys of Heaven, whilſt they feaſt themſelves with the Pleaſures of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Another thing that ſhould be the matter of your frequent ſerious Conſideration, is your latter end and the nearneſs of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. This would make you wiſe indeed, not to lay up riches and diet, much leſs to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up <hi>ſin and wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:134641:137"/>but to lay up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the <hi>appointed time,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. It was the want of ſuch heedful and attentive conſideration, that made <hi>Moſes</hi> complain of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they were <hi>a nation void of Counſel, neither was there any underſtanding in them;</hi> this made him wiſh ſo paſſionately, <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end, Deut.</hi> 32.28, 29. This made the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray ſo to <hi>teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to true wiſdom, Pſal.</hi> 90.121. Who can think what a vapour his life is, <hi>James</hi> 4.14. and make it ſhorter by neglecting the work it was given him for? A man never begins to live, till he lives to God, and he that ſurvives the moſt years, after he hath begun this work, may be truly ſaid to live the longeſt, although he reach not the age of many a Carnal minded man: For a mans life is not to be computed by grey hairs, or the number of years, but by the work that he hath done: If therefore thy work be undone, when death is approaching to thee, what ſhall I ſay that thou haſt lived but a little while; nay, rather that thou haſt not lived at all. I muſt conclude therefore, that to conſider the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy life is the way to lengthen it, and to put thee into ſuch a happy condition, that death ſhall be ſure never to ſurpriſe thee. O what a madneſs it is for men that are to live but a few years (it may be days in the world) never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider it, till their days are at an end; when they have but a few turns more to fetch in this World, not to conſider it, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:134641:137"/>turn unfeignedly to God, before they are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the World; where is that mans Wits that buries his thoughts alive, in the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies of this life and ſcarce thinks from one end of the year to the other that he muſt die: and in that very day his thoughts muſt periſh? What doth that man do that Fidles away his precious time, and never thinks to any purpoſe, that his day is coming, and what a ſad tune he will be then in? If mens thoughts were but frequently, and ſeriouſly imployed about this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, men would not live, and walk about the World for nothing as they do: They would not fiſh all their life time, and catch nothing, but a little worldly pleaſure and honour; which was but a bait that Satan uſed to bring them to this miſery, that now they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting into. Wo! wo be to the man that thinks not of Death, till it is even at his door; That ſees it not till his eyes are ready to cloſe up: That never dreams of it till he is ready to awake in another World! O Sirs, your Souls are here to day, and gone to morrow, and <hi>you know not what one day or night may bring forth, Prov.</hi> 27.1. Though you may think it is the way to a merry, comfortable life, to put the ſerious ſober thoughts of your later end out of your mind; yet I am ſure it is not the way to a comfortable joyful death; and is it not a thouſand times more deſireable to die comfortably than to live comfortably, if you will needs part theſe two one from the other? But I muſt plainly tell you that you are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and that it is not the way to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:134641:138"/>chearful life, to forget a mans latter end; and to decline ſuch a provident Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and Meditation: unleſs you take a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious ſenſual and fooliſh life, for a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table life. And then there's no doubt, but the frequent Conſideration of a mans latter end, will diſturb and interrupt ſuch ſinful, fooliſh mirth. But there are no men in the World, that live a more comfortable, joyful life, and taſte ſo full and true content and pleaſure, as thoſe that have frequently thought upon death, and the conſequent of it, and made it familiar to their thoughts, and have quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the fear of death by a wiſe foreſight of it, and preparation for it. He may well rejoyce oven at the heart that hath overcome his great enemy, and is got over the Rub, that the reſt of the World muſt meet with ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later, that ſhall put an end to their fooliſh mirth and laughter. The conſiderate man hath trampled this King of Terrours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, and through fear of death is no longer ſubject unto bondage, as inconſiderate men are: whereas on the contrary, men that are not accuſtomed to theſe thoughts, nor have brought forth the fruit of them, whenſoever ſuch thoughts accidentaly ruſh into their mind, they cannot bear them; how terrible and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting are the apparitions of death, when they get into their imaginations and fancy? and let them do what they can to ſhift theſe imaginations out of their hearts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other they will ſurprize them, and break in though they ſhut the door never ſo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:134641:138"/>faſt, and bolt them out; and then they pay ſomething for their former inconſideracy: If a Fit of Sickneſs come upon them that threatens them with death, <hi>fearfulneſs and trembling taketh hold on them, and a fit of horrour is ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them, Pſal.</hi> 55.5. What now? Will you call that a merry comfortable life that's ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturbed with one ſad diſmal thought that may ariſe? Will you ſay that man lives a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant life, whom a Hand-writing upon the Wall can damp, and ſtrike into a Fit of Trembling? Will you ſay that that man lives as happily and comfortably, that by ſome ſad accident (a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of which he is ſubject to) may have his Countenance changed, his Thoughts trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him, and the Joynts of his Loyns looſed, and his Knees ſmite one againſt another, as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> had in the midſt of his mirth and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6. Will you call this a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life that will ſo ſoon periſh, and come to a fearful end, or that rather that grows more lightſome and chearful when Death it ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth, and is drawing near? Let a man that's forſaken of Reaſon and Underſtanding forget his latter end, as the fitteſt Expedient to his diſtracted fooliſh mirth; but if thou art Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of any Wit or Reaſon, thou wilt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and cheriſh ſuch thoughts as theſe, as the beginning of true Wiſdom: O remember that die thou muſt, and leave the world behind thee; and woe be to thee if thou haſt not made ſome good preparation for a more laſting life? The night of thy life is even almoſt ſpent, ſee how much the Taper of thy preſent life is already
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:134641:139"/>waſted. If thou knoweſt any thing, thou canſt not but know that it's appointed for all men to die, yea, and that but once, and after Death comes the Judgment; there's no calling back thy time and life when once they are ſpent, no turning up thy glaſs again when once it is run out, no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-game to play after the firſt is loſt, no dying a ſecond time when once thy breath is gone; I mean in this world, though there be a ſecond Death a thouſand times more terrible than the firſt in the world to come. Well, if thou would'ſt live comfortably indeed, yea and die comfortably alſo, conſider thy latter end, be not afraid of ſuch thoughts that will make thee wiſe to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Another Object worthy thy fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſideration, is the Judgment of the Great Day: O what pity is it, that a man that's made for another world, and that muſt be ſolemnly cited before the Tribunal of the Righteous and Impartial Judge, and be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for his whole Life, how he hath ſpent it, ſhould drive ſuch thoughts out of his mind, as <hi>Gallio</hi> drove <hi>Pauls</hi> Accuſers from the Judgment Seat, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.16. and care for none of theſe things! What is it better to ſtand trembling before thy Judge in that day, than to hold up thy Head with confidence? If thou art one that doſt not conſider the Solemnity of that day, nor the Concernments of thine own Soul in that general Aſſembly and appearance, thou art more like to be confounded in that day, than to rejoyce. Would a proud vain-glorious Worldling ſo paſſionately rejoyce in the day of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:134641:139"/>his proſperity, and let his heart chear him in the midſt of his fooliſh pleaſures, and walk in the ways of his heart, and in the ſight of his eyes, if he did but conſider, that for all theſe things God will bring him to Judgment? Would any man caſt off all duty to God, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it with a negligent ſlightneſs and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, to gratifie his lazy fleſh, or a buſie Luſt, if he did but remember and conſider, that for theſe things he muſt be judged, and for theſe (without Repentance before Death) he muſt die for ever? O my Brethren! it is no ſuch contemptible trivial day, nor the buſineſs that muſt then be tranſacted of ſuch ſmall and petty concernment, that you ſhould not think them worth your frequent and conſiderate thoughts: Think you muſt whether you will or no upon trifles, if you refuſe to think on ſuch matters as theſe, and to take this day into your ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: Though you ſhould think on the greateſt worldly matters, and your thoughts be imployed in the management of the Affairs of a Kingdom, yet if you think not upon the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this great and wonderful day, you do but trifle and dream away your precious life. They that have but a Cauſe to be tryed before a Judge of <hi>Niſi Prius</hi> that very much concerns their Eſtates, cannot but remember it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how they may come off with ſucceſs; but thoſe that are to be tryed for their Lives can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſleep, nor talk it out of their mind; by Night the terrible Apparitions of it in their fancies interrupts their repoſe and ſleep; and the horrible thoughts of it in the day time
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:134641:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtrikes them mute, and damps all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; And ſhall not a day far more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, where you muſt undergo a Tryal for your Eternal Eſtate and Life, be conſidered? And it is the more worth your conſideration, becauſe the Judge before whom this Tryal muſt be made, is He that made thy ſelf, and all the World, clothed with his Robes of Majeſty and Juſtice: He that delivered into thy hands thy Reaſon, Memory, Judgment, Freewill, Senſes, Honours, Eſtates, as Talents to be now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; Did not all the Priviledges of thy Birth and Education? Did not all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of thy Infancy, Youth, and Riper Age, come from above? Deny it now if thou canſt: And were not all thy choiceſt deareſt comforts, as Pearls begotten by the Dew of Heaven? His Circuit is not confined to one Nation, or piece of a Nation; but the Circuit that he will ride in that great day ſhall be the Heaven of Heavens, with a glorious Train and Retinue of Saints and Angels; and the people that ſhall be gathered before him, are are the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels and Men; the matters that muſt then be brought to Examination and Tryal, are the ſecret and more publick actions of our whole lives; the Witneſſes that ſhall be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſhall be ſuch as are beyond all Exception, <hi>viz.</hi> mens own Conſciences; the Devil and his Angels that are continually watching our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and the Judge himſelf that can tell the time, the place, the perſons with whom, or the things about which the wickedneſs hath been committed; and the Queſtion that ſhall be
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:134641:140"/>then decided in the face of all the world, ſhall be, whether the perſons thus tryed, ſhall live or die for ever: Theſe are no fidling trifling matters to be ſlighted, nor unworthy your ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forethought and conſideration; beſides the Judge is inflexible, and cannot be bended by force, bribery, or entreaty. If you look into <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.4, 5, 6. you ſhall ſee with what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Majeſty and Terrour this Judg's Proceſs is deſcribed and ſet forth; a fire ſhall devour before him, and it ſhall be very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous round about him; he ſhall call to the Heavens from above, and to the Earth that he may judge his people; and the Heavens ſhall declare his Righteouſneſs, for God is Judge himſelf. Were this day well believed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, men would not live in any faſhion, nor think and ſpeak any thing that comes next, nor do actions that they dare not call themſelves to account for: They would fear their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences more than a thouſand Witneſſes, which in deſpite of them will be privy to all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I warn thee to take heed of this Witneſs, for it will betray thee: If thou art wiſe, when thou haſt any wickedneſs to commit, ſee that neither God, nor the Devil, nor thine own Conſcience have any eye upon thee; and then thou canſt find no place nor time in which thou canſt be ſecure. As it is the great policy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to hide this day from thine eyes, and to keep it out of thy thoughts if he can, that he may take thee Captive at his will; ſo it ſhould be thy chief care to have it continually before thine eyes, that thou mayſt eſcape his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:134641:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>The lively frequent thoughts of this day made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo unwearied in the work of the Lord, and ſo importunate with his hearers; <hi>Knowing the terrours of the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we perſwade men,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. And it was the great Argument he uſed with <hi>Tim.</hi> to ſpur him up to the like diligence, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the Quick and the Dead at his appearing and Kingdom, Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and Doctrine.</hi> And when he did but caſt a flaſh of this day into the eyes of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> you know what effect it had on him, <hi>Acts</hi>

It's madneſs to put this day out of thy mind which God hath put into his Word, as the moſt powerful Curb to all Sin, and the moſt irreſiſtible motive to a ſober, righteous, and a godly life. Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to entertain this day into thy Meditations; the conſideration and forethought of this day doth not make it, but make thee ready for it; whether thou thinkeſt of it or not, it cometh on apace, and thine eyes ſhall ſhortly behold the Solemnity of it, either to thy terrour, or to thy unſpeakable joy.

We are uncapable in this life of true and proper Conceptions of the happineſs of that ſtate, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in general, that it will be ſpiritual, and not like theſe fleſhly pleaſures that here we taſt of: whilſt we are in this Priſon of the Body, we are not able to underſtand the liberty that there we ſhall enjoy; whilſt we are here below in this Dungeon of the body, we are not capable of beholding the light and brightneſs of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But you may ſafely uſe theſe Spectacles to help the dulneſs of your ſight when Heaven is propoſed to you, and take the benefit of theſe groſs expreſſions, if they will but help to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract your deſires, and to raiſe your hopes and expectations more Heavenwards; whilſt you do but remember, that the pleaſures of that ſtate are incomparably greater than all the pleaſures here on Earth, and quite of another kind, that here we want a faculty to expreſs, becauſe we want a faculty to taſt. You know a Horſe or a Cow would take little pleaſure in that food that is moſt delicious to us; yea, and many a man hath pleaſure unintelligible to another man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wants his taſt and experience: And it's very hard to deſcribe pleaſure that depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a taſt and experience that we our ſelves have not.

And certain it is, that all pleaſure is founded in the ſuitableneſs of the Faculty to the Object: Since therefore neither Faculty nor Object ſhall be then the ſame that here we have, the glorious pleaſures of the perfected Saints muſt needs be beyond our Comprehenſions. But if you ſhall reply and ſay, that Grace and Glory differ only gradually, and not ſpecifically, and that they are the ſame in kind, though not in the height of degree; and therefore that the Regenerate, and ſuch as are truly enlightned, and partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, may taſte the Heavenly gift, and the Powers of the world to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. I anſwer, they may better underſtand than others can that want their imperfect grace; but yet there is ſo vaſt a difference between Faith and Sight, perfect and imperfect Knowledge, the Muſtard-ſeed, and the Tree that grows up from it; that you may well ſay it is at the beſt far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their compleat and adequate comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And will not ſuch a happineſs as this be worthy thy frequent conſideration? Thou doſt not ſoundly believe it (ſaith <hi>Drexelius</hi>) if thou doſt but ſeldome and ſlightly think on it: It cannot be that ſuch as penetrate and ſearch into this bleſſedneſs, with lively, active and piercing thoughts, ſhould venture the loſs of it upon any terms. Thou would'ſt have little liſt to part with thy hopes of future happineſs for the gain of all Earthly delights, if Conſideration
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:134641:144"/>had once taught thee what Heaven is; or if the Devil or the world ſhould ſurprize thee before thou haſt well conſidered what it is, and befool thee, to let go the hopes of Eternal Life, for what the World will give thee inſtead of it; thou ſhalt conſider when it is too late, and ſay with that unhappy King that ſold away his Kingdom for a draught of water; <hi>Alas! muſt I for ſo ſhort a pleaſure loſe ſo great a Kingdom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Another thing that it concerns thee much to roul about and conſider with thy deepeſt thoughts, is the horrour and confuſion of thoſe that muſt be baniſhed for ever from the face of God, and ſentenced to everlaſting miſery: There's none that eſcape that place but thoſe that frequently think on it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, its well worth thy ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſerve thy ſoul from ſuch a fearful deſtruction. Many a man whom God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened to believe thoſe terrible endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have retired themſelves from all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noiſe and diſturbance, that they might live under the power of theſe thoughts, as the beſt preſervative againſt theſe torments. And is not thy Soul as dear and precious to thee as their's to them, and deſerve as much compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thee? Surely though it is not thy duty to think actually of the woful and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate of unbelievers, all the day long; Yet it's of abſolute neceſſity, that ſome ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts ſhould be ſpent on that ſubject till the fear thereof make void and prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Carnal worldly fears whatſoever: And make thee more induſtrious to prevent that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:134641:144"/>miſery, than thou art to eſcape the ſcorn and and reproach, and all the ſufferings and miſeries of this life: otherwiſe thou art never like to eſcape it. And methinks, thou ſhould'ſt eaſily believe, that Hell is more to be feared than all the Calamities of this Life, and the loſs of this Life it ſelf: But thus it will never be, if thou art not one that doſt often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to thy thoughts. A danger though it be never ſo great, yet if it be both out of ſight and mind alſo, will fright no body nor have any the leaſt influence upon our endeavours to eſcape it. The evil muſt be before the eye of our ſenſe or underſtanding, that works upon us to take the beſt courſe for our ſecurity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: And the nearer we apprehend it to be, the more haſt we make to get away from it: And whether a wicked man hath no reaſon to think his woful miſery near, even at the door, I leave any man to Judge that hath any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent uſe of his underſtanding: what can you name almoſt that's more uncertain then this Life? and ſo ſoon as ever it ends, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his diſtreſs that ſhall never end. But yet let him not be too confident that it ſhall not begin before: Many a man hath felt the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell on this ſide the grave, and this Judgment hath commenc'd before his life hath been concluded, <hi>ſome mens ſins go before them to Judgment,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and ſome mens fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. There is ſome men feel the Vengeance of a righteous Judge even in this Life; <hi>Spira</hi> profeſſed that he felt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire of Gods wrath in his heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:134641:145"/>whilſt he was alive and openly blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maker, wiſhing that he was above him, for he knew (as he ſaid) <hi>that he would have no mercy on him:</hi> O Sirs, the intollerable pains that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very impenitent Sinner muſt ſpeedily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, are well worth the pains of a few hours Conſideration to prevent, and if you think it not ſo, you may ſpare your pains a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, till your lamentable experience ſhall put you quite out of all doubt. If indeed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of your thoughts from ſo ſad an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject were the way to ſecure your Souls, and to keep out of that devouring and unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire, then you might well excuſe your ſelves from troubling your minds with ſuch thoughts as theſe: But though you may quench the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God that moveth you to Conſider of this and to let it ſink into your heart, that you may ſeek for mercy whilſt it may be had; yet you cannot quench the flames of Hell, nor extinguiſh that fire that muſt feed upon your ſoul and body for ever. O how much better is it cooly to Conſider the intolerableneſs of Gods wrath; then to feel the burning heat and extremity of his indignation, when there is no remedy! If it were indeed but a flea bite, you might ſlight it, and keep your thoughts for ſomething of more weight and moment: Or if it were unavoidable perhaps, you might do wiſely not to torment your ſelves before the time; nor invite ſuch a gueſt till it comes of his own accord. 'Tis to no purpoſe to think of ſuch ſufferings, which thinking will not prevent; But believe it, it is no flea-bite, nor
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:134641:145"/>a matter to be ſlighted: Fire, and Sword, and Rack, and all the inventions of Cruelty that were ever found out, are but Sport and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation to the Judgment and Condemnation of the Life to come: And becauſe the loſs of God and Heaven ſeems ſuch a tolerable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to theſe Veſſels of wrath; Let me tell them that there's no part or member ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Soul or Body, that ſhall not be racked with perpetual and eternal pain: <hi>And can thine heart endure or thine hands be ſtrong when he ſhall come to deal with thee, Ezek.</hi> 22.14. Thou would'ſt eat thy bread with tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and drink thy drink with terrour and aſtoniſhment, if he ſhould pour out on thee ſome few bitter drops of his diſpleaſure now in this life, <hi>Thou even thou</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to Almighty God, whoſe Judgments thou deſpiſeſt) <hi>art greatly to be feared, and who may ſtand in thy ſight when once thou art angry, Pſal.</hi> 76.7. what trembling eyes and what a failing heart have they whom God doth a little terrifie with ſome frowns of his anger here on earth; you may hear them cry out in the morning would God it were evening, and in the evening would God it were morning, for the fear of thine heart, wherewith thou ſhalt fear, and for the fear of thine eyes which thou ſhalt ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.6, 51, 67. How dolefully doth <hi>Job</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain under his outward ſufferings (though he had Integrity to ſupport him, and the root of Comfort was within him) <hi>Job.</hi> 19.28. Death it ſelf (it ſeems) would have been welcome to him under the heavy preſſures which he felt, as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:134641:146"/>we may ſee in <hi>Job</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>&amp;c. Wherefore is light given to him that is in miſery, and life to the bitter in Soul; which long for death, but it cometh not, and dig for it more than for hid treaſures; which rejoyce exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the grave? Why is life given to a man whoſe way is hid, and whom God hath hedg'd in; for my ſighing cometh before I eat, and my roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are poured out like water?</hi> And how <hi>David</hi> was ready to faint away many a time under the apprehenſions of Gods diſpleaſure; it's the deſign of many a paſſage in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to tell you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Make me to hear of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the bones which thou haſt broken may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> So <hi>Pſa.</hi> 22.14, 15. what a ſad Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have you? <hi>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joynt; my heart is like wax, it's melted in the midſt of my bowels; my ſtrength is dried up like a Potſheard, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws, and thou haſt brought me into the duſt of death.</hi> So <hi>Pſa.</hi> 31.9, 10. <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; mine eye is conſumed with grief, yea my Soul and my Belly; for my life is ſpent with grief, and my years with ſighing, my ſtrength faileth becauſe of mine iniquity, and my bones are conſumed.</hi> But if you look into the 88 <hi>Pſal.</hi> the caſe of <hi>Heman</hi> ſeems there to be far more ſad, becauſe it was more conſtant and uninterrupted than <hi>David</hi>'s was, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16. &amp;c. <hi>Lord, why caſteſt thou off my Soul? why hideſt thou thy face from me? I am afflicted, and ready to die from my youth up, whilſt I ſuffer thy terrours I am diſtracted: Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy terrours have caſt me off, they came
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:134641:146"/>round about me daily like water, they compaſſed me about together; Lover and Friend haſt thou put far from me, and mine Acquaintance into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And how pitifully doth the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain under the effects of Gods ſharp diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as you may ſee in the Book of the <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?</hi> So that you may perceive by theſe few inſtances, that the wrath of God even on this ſide Hell is not to be ſlighted; and if a drop or two light ſo heavy upon men that had ſuch grace, courage, and fortitude to bear up under it, how heavy muſt it needs be, when it falls with its whole weight upon men in the ſtate of torments? Wo be to them on whom it falls, it will grind them to powder. If a little ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be ſo ſharp and terrible ſometime, that it makes a ſtout heart to ſpeak trembling, and turns a freſh coloured face into paleneſs, and makes the beauty thereof to conſume away, like a Garment fretted by a Moth; How will men ſpeak and look under the pains of the ſecond death? How reſtleſs are men under ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſtempers? they toſs up and down, and tell the hours, and watch for the Morning Light, in hope the Sun ſhould riſe upon them with healing in its wings; And if men roar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Fit of the Gout or Collick, what then ſhall they do in Hell?</p>
                  <p>And as the torments of Hell are no Flea bite, nor to be ſlighted by any the ſtouteſt heart, ſo neither are they unavoidable; for then I ſhould not recommend them to your Conſideration. But when the miſery of that place cannot find a tongue to utter and expreſs it, nor ſet forth
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:134641:147"/>the greatneſs of it, and Conſideration is ſuch a certain way to eſcape it, who but a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or one that doth not believe it, will refuſe at leaſt ſome time to think ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on it till he hath ſome well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope to eſcape it? I will take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that that man is reſolved to try his ſtrength and ſee how well he can bear it, that will not endure the ſober deliberate thoughts of it in his mind. O Sirs, if when an Angel of light deſcended from heaven and came and rolled back the ſtone from the mouth of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, where our Saviour was buried, and ſate upon it, the guilty Keepers for fear of him did ſhake, and became as dead men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.2, 4. How will ſuch as are condemned to Hell ſhake and tremble, when Angels of Darkneſs ſhall continually appear before them? That horrible ſight, together with the inward terrours of their own deſpairing Conſciences, will fright them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting trembling and fearfulneſs: If thou haſt a mind to eſcape that place of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual darkneſs and deſpair, conſider it well now, and let it ſink into thy ſerious thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conſider the infallible truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianty of all this. I confeſs there is ſomething that is dubious and uncertain in every one of theſe particulars; but yet there is ſomething alſo that is of the higheſt certainty; ſomething that you may well make a queſtion of, but yet ſomething that's paſt all controverſie and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Let me give you a brief Recapitulation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There's nothing more certain than that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:134641:147"/>there is a God, and that he is Infinite in all perfections; that he hath made all Creatures, and that he is the abſolute Lord and Governour of Mankind, and his principal Benefactor.</p>
                  <p>Thus much is unqueſtionable.</p>
                  <p>But it is a very great queſtion, whether thou doſt acknowledge him ſincerely for thy Owner, Soveraign, and one that hath every way obliged thee, and art truly devoted to him in heart and life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's moſt certain, that he hath made thee for no lower Ends than his ſervice; and that he hath given thee a Law to teach thee how he will be ſerved; and that he expecteth thou ſhouldeſt be heartily ſubject to him, and obedient to his Laws; and that thou ſhould'ſt believe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently wait for his rewards in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>But it is a matter of Enquiry and Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whether thou haſt anſwered this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of God in thy Creation, and obeyed his Laws in a confident expectation of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is paſt doubt, that thou haſt broken the Law of thy Creation, corrupted thy Nature, lived in Diſobedience, and caſt off the Yoke of thy Creator; that thou haſt by Original and Actual Tranſgreſſions forfeited thy life, and all thy other mercies, and deſerveth to be dealt with as a Rebel and a Traytor to thy Soveraign Lord and Ruler.</p>
                  <p>But it is a matter of doubt, and therefore ſhould be ſeriouſly enquired by thee, whether thou doſt acknowledge from thy heart, and art ſenſible of thy ſin and miſery thereby. All the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:134641:148"/>world are miſerable, but they are but few that are affected with their miſery.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is certain, that Chriſt hath ſhed his Blood to redeem all Mankind, and that Pardon and Remiſſion is offered to all that do heartily repent and believe; <hi>That God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, John</hi> 3.16. That none are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Act of Oblivion and Free-grace, but ſuch as refuſe the Mercy offered, and continue in wilful impenitency and unbelief. <hi>You will not come unto me that you may have life,</hi> John 5.40.</p>
                  <p>But it is a matter of very great doubt and queſtion, whether thou haſt any ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; whether thou haſt ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed thy corrupt Nature that was born with thee into the world, and thy Rebellion againſt thy Maker in the courſe of thy life, and wilful tranſgreſſion of his Laws; and whether thou art ſo deeply wounded with the bitter ſenſe of thy ſin, as to ſubmit to the Yoke and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, that he may deliver thee from the bondage of thy ſins: For though Chriſt be offered to all, and did intentionally lay down his life for all, yet none ſhall reap the fruit and benefit of his ſufferings and ſatisfaction, but ſuch as are broken in heart for their iniquities, and come believingly unto him to bind them up again, and heal them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What more certain than the vanity of all things here below, and their utter inſufficiency
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:134641:148"/>to ſatisfie the Soul of Man, and make it happy? Every one that is not wilfully blind may ſee how ridiculous the Competition is between God and them. The greateſt <hi>Epicures,</hi> and thoſe that dote moſt upon the world, and admire its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will confeſs thus much when they come to die; and their eyes are then opened, for the moſt part, whoſe very Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as their affections, were wholly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated to its deluding pleaſures all their life-long. Ask them now which is better, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, or the Pleaſures of the World, and they will not then ſtick to tell you, there's no compariſon between them; you ſhall have a free and a full confeſſion from them.</p>
                  <p>But yet though the World be ſuch an empty thing, and not worthy to be laid in the balance with the Favour of God, and an Intereſt in Chriſt; yet it is a great queſtion whether it is ſo indeed in thy Eſtimation and Affections: Let thy practice, and the courſe and tenour of thy life decide the caſe; Which doeſt thou ſtudy and endeavour to ſerve and pleaſe moſt? Which doeſt thou labour moſt after, the Food that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, or the Food that endureth? Which doeſt thou make the moſt careful proviſion for, this life, or the life to come? It concerns thee as much as the Salvation of thy Soul comes to, to put this as much out of doubt, as it is paſt doubt that the World is altogether vanity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How ſure is it that Death will ſhortly come and part thy Soul and Body, and give thee thy mortal wound, and turn thy fleſh into corruption? Not a man but muſt ſhortly make
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:134641:149"/>his Bed in the Grave, and be forgotten as a dead man out of ſight, and leave his ſubſtance to thoſe that come after. This is a clear truth, and hath a ſound confeſſion from all the world; the experience of all our Forefathers is a clear proof.</p>
                  <p>But yet though this truth is ſo fully atteſted by the confeſſion of all the living, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all the Dead; yet it is a very great doubt whether thou doſt remember and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy latter end, and improve thy life, as that which will not always laſt. Wo to thee if this be not as certain as the other!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nothing more ſure, than that there is a Publick <hi>Audit,</hi> at which all men muſt give up their Accounts; a general day of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> where every one muſt undergo an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Tryal and Examination.</p>
                  <p>But it is uncertain whether thou doſt ſincerely believe ſuch a day, and doſt make anſwerable preparations; and whether thou doſt live as in the ſight of thy Judge, it behoves thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It's matter of greateſt certainty, that there is a State of unſpeakable happineſs for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and that there is a State of endleſs and unſufferable miſery to which Unbelievers ſhall he condemned; and when men are arrived thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their condition is unalterable; there's no poſſibility that they ſhould loſe the one, or ever be releaſed from the other Theſe are all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the higheſt certainty; all the doubt is, whether thou haſt lived under the power of theſe Truths by frequent Conſideration; and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:134641:149"/>whether they had ſuch influence on thee, as things of ſuch certainty, weight and worth ſhould have.</p>
                  <p>You ſee what is certain, and what is doubtful and uncertain in all theſe particulars; and in both reſpects they will deſerve thy attentive, heedful thoughts, and thy moſt impartial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. The things that are certain will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make their due impreſſion upon thy heart, nor operate according to their worth, nor put thee upon anſwerable practice till they be again and again conſidered. The things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, will never be reſolved till they be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conſidered: Men regard not the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, becauſe they will not be brought to conſider the certainty of it, and how much it doth concern them. Men ſlight the Torments of Hell, and Joys of Heaven, becauſe they will not conſider the certainty of them. Would any one fall in love with the world, if he did but conſider how certainly it will deceive him? Would men live ſo improvidently, and ſpend their ſtrength and time ſo impertinently, if they did but ſeriouſly conſider that they muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly die, and ſpeed Eternally as they have lived? Would men ſet up their own will for a Law, and live to themſelves, and put the fear of God out of their hearts, if they did but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God is certainly their Maker and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and that they owe perfect ſubjection to his Perſon, and obedience to his Laws? Would men live ſo abſurdly, and forget their main Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand in the world, and the principal buſineſs of their lives, if they did but conſider that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:134641:150"/>God certainly ſent them into the world for this very end and purpoſe to ſerve him, and live in love and obedience to him? In a word, would men wipe their mouths after ſo much Rebellion and Diſobedience to God, as if they were Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and be ſo impenitent and unaffected with their ſins, if they did but conſider how certain it is, that without Repentance there's no hope of pardon; and that they muſt ſmart for their ſin here by Repentance, or elſe hereafter in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery and deſperation; and that Chriſt will be a Saviour to none but thoſe that thus ſmart for their ſin, and feel its intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and fly unto him by Faith as their only refuge. O if we did enough conſider the great certainty of theſe things, they would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother effect and operation on us, than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they have upon the beſt of us; much leſs would they ſuffer us to live in ſuch Atheiſm, and contempt of Chriſt and Salvation, as the moſt of men live. As ſure as thou ſinneſt now thou ſhalt be judged for it, and that to Everlaſting Condemnation, if thy ſerious Repentance ſtep not in between; as ſure as thou liveſt now, thou ſhalt ſhortly die; and as ſure as thou tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon the Earth, ſo ſure ſhalt thou lie down in it e're long, and be trodden under foot. Look up and behold the Heavens above thee, that gliſter with ſo many Stars of light; as ſure as they now hang over thy head, ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhall they be under thy feet e're a few years more be paſt: If thou haſt laid up thy Treaſure in Heaven, I mean, if thy chief joy and delight be there; if there be any truſt in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:134641:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Lord, any truth and certainty in his Word, theſe things which I have recommended to thy frequent Conſideration, are Truths of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt certainty and importance; the flattering World may deceive thee, thy falſe diſſembling heart may deceive thee; health, and ſtrength, and friends may prove treacherous and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; all thy worldly hopes may become like a Spiders Web, <hi>Job</hi> 8.14. The Heavens over thy head may turn into darkneſs, and the Sun and Stars may refuſe to give their light, the Earth may fail under thy feet, and reel to and fro, and ſtagger like a Drunken Man, and the Inhabitants thereof may be at their wits end, but the Word of God will never fail thee; it ſhall be accompliſhed in deſpight of all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power, and the threatnings and promiſes thereof ſhall ſtand, when all other things ſhall fall to the ground, and be like water that's ſpilt on it, that cannot be gathered up again; <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not one jot nor tittle of the Word of God ſhall paſs, till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, Mat.</hi> 5.18. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.35. God that hath eſtabliſhed the Earth ſo firmly (though it hang upon nothing) and it abideth, and ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide till the great Earthquake ſhall come; he that hath fixed the Ordinances of Heaven and Earth, and ſetled the appointed times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Spring and Summer, Winter and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, Day and Night, and they continue to this da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I come in the next place to ſpeak to the <hi>manner,</hi> or to ſhew <hi>how</hi> Conſideration ſhold be exerciſed. <hi>Firſt,</hi> after you have lift up your heart to God for the heavenly Light and Aſſiſtance, ſet your ſelf <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> to the duty as in his ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Trifling with all matters of moment is inconſiſtent with the nature of ſuch things, and betrays our folly. But it is the bane and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all Religion, and a wicked diſparagement both to that and our ſelves: <hi>if whatſoever our hand findeth to do, we ſhould do it with our might,</hi> (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10.) then much more ſhould we rouze up our ſelves, and put to all our ſtrength when we have works of the greateſt conſequence in our hands, we muſt not be ſlothful in ſuch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as this is eſpecially, <hi>but fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> is a precept that extends it ſelf to all Religious Acts and ſtrictly forbids a ſlight and cuſtomary perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them. Thou art guilty of Irreverence and contempt of ſuch ſacred things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of God himſelf to whom they are nearly related, when thou medleſt in them, with a careleſs and wandring ſpirit, and mayeſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:134641:151"/>expect that the anger of the Lord ſhould wax hot againſt thee, when thou art ſo cold in his ſervice. If God threatned to ſpew the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> out of his mouth, becauſe ſhe was but lukewarm in his ſervice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16. He will certainly deal worſe with them that are ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold in their approaches to him. The heart and ſoul of Conſideration, and all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acts are wanting, when the heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength are not imployed in them: For when earneſtneſs and ſerious intention of the mind and heart are deficient, it not only turns Religious Acts into meer form, but makes them utterly unſucceſsful: You will miſs of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purpoſe, when you come to God and ſeek for mercy in a careleſs and cuſtomary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: you will never obtain wiſdom at the hands of God if you know not how to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for it: when you are ſhut up in affliction and miſery and cannot get out, if you cannot cry aloud and knock at the door of grace it will never be opened to you. The Lord will give you a praying ſpirit fervent in ſupplication, if ever he intend to give you the thing prayed for: He will give you a heart ſeriouſly to Conſider if ever he work the ſaving truths into your heart: if you are not ſerious in the ſervice of God you cannot be ſincere, and how well God will accept that ſervice in which ſincerity is wanting, look into the word of God and Judge. The Conſideration I am preſſing you to, is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of Gods Worſhip, (I ſpeak not of that which is occaſional and ordinary, for ſuch Conſideration muſt accompany all your Actions
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:134641:152"/>both toward God and men; if ever they be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently managed) but of that Conſideration, which is ſet and ſolemn, and that requires ſome time to be ſet apart for it, as well as Prayer and other Duty; during which time we muſt no more intermix our thoughts with worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then we muſt in Prayer, and Hearing, and Reading the Word of God: But our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations muſt be tied to the moſt weighty ſaving truths till we begin to feel the power of them upon our hearts; that ſo they may command our Lives. 'Tis ſuch ſerious Conſideration as this, about the greateſt and uncontroverted truths for ſome ſet time together, till ſuitable affections and reſolutions be kindled in us, which is ſuch an excellent part of Gods Worſhip: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it inſpires the Soul with Life and Fitneſs for all other Worſhip and Service, and if you do not awaken, and call up the powers of your Soul and ſeriouſly imploy them in this work of Conſideration, you are never like to ſee the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of theſe ſaving truths, nor to feel the mighty power of them. Ignorance and prejudice have ſo faſt cloſed the eyes of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that unleſs you rub hard they will never be opened; and the affections are ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the moſt weighty things, that unleſs they be ſet upon in good earneſt, and enforced by the evidence and mighty power of theſe truths they will not ſtir to any purpoſe, nor ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your Soul for Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> You muſt narrowly watch over your heart, and keep it cloſe to the work; and when it refuſeth, you muſt uſe the Authority God
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:134641:152"/>hath given you over it to compel it. Though the Soul hath not that abſolute command over its own thoughts and affections which once it had before it rebelled againſt God, yet it hath not quite loſt its Soveraignty and power. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth ſufficiently aſſure us, that we can command our thoughts to this or that ſubject, &amp; keep them on it, if we will take pains with them; even thoſe that want the ſpecial Grace of God, and are unſanctified in heart, can yet bend their thoughts to think on God, his Attributes, and his Word and Works, the Life to come, the vanity of Creatures, and make very pertinent moving diſcourſes on them: elſe none can Preach but ſuch as are endued with ſaving Light and Knowledge, much more may they command their Meditations to theſe heavenly Subjects, that have ſome prevailing love to them which every Carnal man is deprived of. I know the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not ſo eaſily compell'd as the thoughts: It muſt be the clearneſs, and importunity of the underſtanding that muſt excite and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the affections: But yet ſerious Meditation on ſuch weighty moving objects as theſe are (on which your Meditations ſhould be exerciſed) will do much to ſtir the fire, and make the heart feel what the mind doth ſo clearly underſtand; It is the way that God hath preſcribed for a man to prevail with his own heart, to take it off from vanity, and enamour it with thoſe things that are Divine and Heavenly. Objects and moving reaſons kept much upon the mind by ſerious thoughts, are the great Engine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both by Nature and by Grace to turn about
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:134641:153"/>the Soul of Man; and they are to the Soul as Meat and Drink, and taking in the Air to the Body. Objects, well conſidered, do turn the Soul into their Nature (ſaith a Reverend and a moſt skilful Divine) when therefore your mind begins to be weary of theſe thoughts, and to rove and wander, fetch it in again, and lay your charge and command upon it; and if that will not do, urge the Command &amp; Authority of God, and be ſure not to let it bafle thee: <hi>Quicquid imperavit Animas obtinuit,</hi> ſaith that Excellent Heathen, <hi>Sen. de ira.</hi> You are like to profit no further in the heavenly duty of Conſideration at firſt, than you force and compel your ſelf: <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum proficies quantum tibi vim intuleris: Claud, Clem. Bib.</hi> But the ſucceſs will make amends for all. Think it not a tedious unpleaſant task to attend the Affairs of your own Soul, and to do a work ſo pleaſing unto God. What haſt thou thy time and faculties for, if not to imploy them in his ſervice that gave thee both time and faculties? Doeſt thou grudge to ſet them a work to thine own unſpeakable advantage? Had'ſt thou rather live like a Beaſt, than like a Man in the beſt uſe and exerciſe of thy Reaſon? Check thy ſelf after this manner when thy Mind begins to be unruly, and thy fleſhly brutiſh part would call thee off from the moſt rational im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of thy time in ſuch wiſe and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thoughts for thine Eternal happineſs: ſometimes thy mind will loiter, and then it will be thy duty to ſpur it up by the moſt perſwaſive quickning Arguments thou canſt ſuggeſt to it; (and ſuch thou ſhouldeſt have ready at hand to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:134641:153"/>ſerve for that uſe) ſometimes it will divert, and then thou ſhould'ſt Rein it in with as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as thou would'ſt an unruly Beaſt that would carry thee out of thy way; and when thy heart is ready to fruſtrate all theſe helps, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix ſome ſhort Ejaculations to God with thy Meditations, and appeal to him for ſtrength to Maſter thy own thoughts and affections: If thou gaineſt the Victory, thou haſt done more than if thou hadſt conquered a Kingdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Addreſs thy ſelf to this Duty with the confident expectations of a bleſſing: Think there is more to be gained this way, than by any other exerciſe of thy mind; the ſtronger thy hopes are of a bleſſing that will anſwer all thy pains, the more chearfully will the work go on. If thou expecteſt nothing in this way of obedience to God, and exerciſe of thy thoughts, but art dragg'd to it meerly by the threats of thine own Conſcience, that telleth thee roundly it is thy duty, it will be done with little pleaſure, and as little profit: But if thou wouldeſt make a Vertue of Neceſſity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that willingly that muſt be done however, then ſweeten thy labour by the Harveſt that will come in, and take as much pains to gratifie thy Soul for ever, and to ſow in it the Seed of endleſs felicity, as thou would'ſt to ſow thy Land, that thou mayeſt enjoy the Crop that it promiſeth to bring thee forth. Thou doeſt thy ſelf wrong to leave out ſuch thoughts as theſe when thou art ſetting about the work of Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; they will infuſe life into thy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:134641:154"/>to think that they ſhall not be in vain in the Lord. The harder the Duty is that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, the greater is the gain after it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly perform'd. It's ſinful deſpair and unbelief that weakneth our hands to Prayer and Meditation, and cutteth the Nerves and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of all Duty. This bringeth a damp upon us, and diſcourageth all our endeavours: As ever therefore thou would'ſt perform this Duty with any life, perform it in hope. If thou hadſt no other hope but to pleaſe God in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a Duty ſo highly acceptable to him, even this alone were well worth thy pains: But when thou mayeſt be ſure that this Duty of Conſideration therefore pleaſeth God, becauſe it is ſo fit a means to advance thy ſelf in ſaving knowledge and vertue, and to make the beſt improvement of thine intellectuals and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to lay the true and ſolid grounds of endleſs pleaſure and felicity, thou haſt a Spur indeed to quicken thee: But this is not all, thou mayſt alſo hope oft-times to find the ſweeteſt content and pleaſure in ſuch exerciſe of thy thoughts. So that whereas there are but three ſorts of that which we call good, or three Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, to which all that is deſirable may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, viz. <hi>Bonum honeſtum, utile, &amp; jucundum:</hi> For all that is good is either (1.) Honeſt. (2.) Profitable. (3.) Pleaſant: Thou haſt ground ſure enough to hope, that they will all concur in the Conſcientious performance of this Duty. To expect indeed to grow wiſe in any other way than God hath authorized and appointed, would be a fooliſh confidence and preſumption,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:134641:154"/>and ſuch as would certainly end in diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſhame; But to expect a bleſſing in ſuch an unqueſtionable way of duty, (as Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is) which both nature and Scripture do ſo plainly teach thee, this is no raſh but a well grounded hope: Addreſs your ſelf to the duty of Conſideration with ſuch hopes as theſe; and you ſhall find (if other neceſſaries alſo do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur) that the work will proſper in your hand, and you alſo will proſper by it: <hi>Then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,</hi> Prov. 2.5. <hi>Yea, thou ſhalt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Righteouſneſs, and Judgment, and Equity, and every good Path,</hi> verſ. 9. Try this courſe, and throw out all diſturbing hindring thoughts out of thy mind, and do but conſider ſome of theſe weighty Truths which I have recommended to thee, and aſſault thine own affections with the moving power of them, and ſee whether thy time be miſs-ſpent, or thy labour loſt. Aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſdom will enter into thine heart, and Knowledge will be pleaſant unto thy Soul; Diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall keep thee, and deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth &amp; thinketh froward things, who leaveth the paths of uprightneſs, to walk in the ways of darkneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12, 13. If the hope of a little worldly gain, will put the Merchant upon ſuch difficult, tedious, yea and dangerous Voyages, and to expoſe himſelf to the raging boyſtrous Seas and Winds, and to go viſit the Savage and Barbarous Nations, that he may bring back a little fading Treaſure; would not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:134641:155"/>the hope of far better and greater gain put Sails to thine endeavours, and quicken thee to Conſideration? It's certain, that if thou doeſt account Wiſdom and Grace better than Gold and Silver, it would do ſo. In this ſpiritual Trade of Commerce with God by Meditation, there is leſs of danger, and more of profit and advantage: Though I confeſs the profit is quite of another kind, but yet ſuch as will yield thee more pleaſure and content than any worldly gain and Emolument can do; yea, mayeſt thou not expect a Harveſt, far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable to a man that is not brutiſh in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after one Months exerciſe of this Duty, though but one half hour in a day, than the poor induſtrious Plow-man can after ten times as much ſpent in a dirty and unpleaſant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: And yet how chearfully doth he riſe to the Plow and Cart before the day break, and deſpiſe his reſt and eaſe for a ſmall Crop which he expects; and it may be when all is done, his hopes are drowned by unſeaſonable Showres, and too great a glut of moiſt and rainy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or elſe they wither through too great an exceſs of heat and drought? But God will not fail to water thine endeavours, if thou wilt bend thy mind daily to Conſideration, and Crown thine endeavours with a bleſſing. How indefatigably will a poor man threſh and toil all the day and year long for a poor contemptible Livelihood? And would'ſt thou not take an hours pains every day to live a glorious happy life for ever, if thou didſt but hope for ſuch a Reward? Certainly they expect no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:134641:155"/>or elſe value it at a lower rate than their worldly eaſe and pleaſure, that will not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon ſuch terms as theſe; and they are like to neglect or faint in the work of Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that do not addreſs themſelves to it with ſuch hopes as theſe. I have done with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that concern both the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of this Duty of Conſideration; and now come</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place to tell you, <hi>what End</hi> you ſhould propoſe to your ſelf in the exerciſe of this Duty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ends</hi> that you ſhould propoſe are theſe two;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That you might get, and grow in the love of God, joy and delight in him, praiſe and admiration of him, gratitude and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him; and ſo God may be more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced in your heart and affections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And that you may grow up to a more habitual, firm and ſetled reſolution of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Laws, and ſubmiſſion to his Providences, and ſo God may be more highly exalted in your life and practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt great End that you ſhould aim at in the exerciſe of Conſideration, is that you may provoke and ſtrengthen thoſe good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of love to God, delight in him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him, thankfulneſs to him; and ſo to raiſe his Authority in your heart: Not that I exclude any other holy affections, either of the Iraſcible or Concupiſcible Faculty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Soveraignty of God over Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is made more glorious and ſenſible: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:134641:156"/>do I except any Acts of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as are eſteem and admiration of him, aſſent to his Word and Truth, both in Nature, but eſpecially in Scripture, whereby way is made for theſe higher and more Noble affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love, Joy, and Praiſe. But you muſt ſee that all the other affections be guided to, and end in theſe, eſpecially Love: For this is the Leading Act or Affection of the Soul (that vertually contains, yea and commands all the reſt) and doth enthrone the Object to which it is mainly devoted in the heart, and ſets the Crown upon its head, and offereth up the whole train of affections that come after it to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir and ſervice. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeems to maintain that love is the only paſſion that doth agitate us, and hath its operation in us; for all the paſſions that moleſt our Souls, are but ſo many diſguized Loves; our fears and deſires, our hopes and deſpairs, our delights and ſorrows, are Countenances which Love puts on accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Events of good or bad ſucceſs. And as the Sea carries different Names, according to the divers parts of the Earth which it waſheth, ſo doth Love change her Name, according to the different ſtate wherein ſhe finds her ſelf: His words are, <hi>Amor inhians habere quod amatur Cupiditas eſt, Idem habens eoque fruens Laetitia eſt: Fugiens quod ei Adverſatur, Timor eſt. Idque cum Acciderit ſentiens Triſtitia eſt.</hi> The truth is (as moſt now grant) there are no Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Affections of the Soul that are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from it ſelf, but the Soul it ſelf is thus variouſly denominated, according to the various Objects about which it is exerciſed; yea, the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:134641:156"/>Underſtanding and Will are no otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed than by their Objects, and are not Faculties really diſtinct: But the ſame Soul, as it ſees, apprehends, and diſcerneth either truth or falſhood, it's called Underſtanding; and as it chuſeth or refuſeth good and evil, it's called Will. But (though you ſuppoſe this) yet there are two Primitive and moſt Eſſential Acts or Affections of the Will, and thoſe are <hi>Volition</hi> and <hi>Nolition,</hi> commonly called Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, of which all the other Affections have a Spice, and from whence they are derived. All the Paſſions which are uſually aſcribed to the Concupiſcible Faculty, flow from <hi>Volition</hi> or Love; and all that are commonly reckoned as Retainers to the Iraſcible Faculty, flow from <hi>Nolition</hi> or Hatred. Theſe be the two Acts whereby the Soul cleaves to its moſt endeared Object, (wherein it placeth its reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and whereby it fights againſt all Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries that would take it out of its arms, or hinder it from fruition.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are therefore the main Affections that you ſhould endeavour more and more to root and fortifie by your Meditations, (even love to God, and hatred of all that ſtands in any competition with, or contradiction to him.) Now ſince the World with its Pleaſures, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Honours, is <hi>the curſed Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> that moſt oppoſeth God, and that is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to draw your Soul firſt to ſlight, and then to rebel againſt the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> your great intention in the work of Conſideration, muſt be to fortifie and ſtrengthen your love to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:134641:157"/>the laſt, and your hatred to the firſt, to hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. For you cannot ſerve God and the World, becauſe their Commands are quite contrary; and whilſt you do fulfill the will of the one, you do <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ſlight the other. Indeed where two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtand in ſubordination one to the other, there we may ſerve and pleaſe them both; but then they are not two, but one Maſter; ſo long as the Commands of one do not croſs, but promote and further the Commands of the other. In this caſe God and the World may both be loved. So long as our love to the world doth not exceed thoſe bounds which God hath ſet, and we love them no farther than as they further us in his ſervice. For inſtance, friends may help us forward towards Heaven, and quicken us to our duty; and friends may incumber, diſcourage and hinder us in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God: The firſt ſort one may and muſt love for that very end; the ſecond ſort, we ought to ſlight and deſpiſe, ſo far as they are ſuch a ſnare to us. Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine Enemies, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> though it may be ſome of them might be his friends by birth and Alliance, or pretence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22. Not but that we own ſome kind and degree of love, even to ſuch as theſe; but not a love of Complacency, which is the moſt proper ſort of love, and the higheſt degree: we may look upon them with a love of Benevolence and Compaſſion, deſiring
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:134641:157"/>their Repentance and Reformation, if they are ſuch Enemies of God as are curable: And the reaſon is, becauſe there is ſome mixture of good with all their wickedneſs, and this we muſt love them for. So we ſhould examine all other worldly comforts, and ſee how far they kindle, and how far they extinguiſh the love of God in you; and ſo far you muſt love or hate them. Well, in the exerciſe of Conſideration, you muſt ſtill have one eye to this affection of love, and ſee that it grow ſtronger and ſtronger, and another upon every thing that you ſeem to love too much, whether it be meat, or drink, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, or friends, or credit, or health, or life it ſelf, to diſparage them, and leſſen your eſteem of, and affections to them; and think what a vaſt difference there is between any worldly comfort here on Earth, and God the Author of that and all other comforts: I mean no other diſparagement than ſuch a one as makes them know their place, and keep their rank, and lays them at the feet of him that ought to be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times dearer to us: And ſo the Apoſtle counted all things dung and droſs in compariſon with Chriſt, but not otherwiſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Now the more diſtinct and certain knowledge you have of God, the more you are like to love him; for he is ſuch an Object, that if he be once thoroughly known, he cannot but be loved. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon it ſelf will ſufficiently aſſure you, that his Word is the higheſt Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth of any thing he affirmeth, and cannot poſſibly be falſe: The more therefore you are perſwaded that the Scripture or Bible
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:134641:158"/>is his Word, wherein he hath made the plaineſt Diſcoveries of himſelf, the more clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain apprehenſions of God you are like to have. It will be therefore very ſubſervient to the love of God to confirm and ſtrengthen your aſſent to the Truth or Divine Authority of Scripture, and to make that ſometimes the immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and buſineſs of your Meditations; to which end you muſt have Arguments at hand to prove Scripture to be the Word of God, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force your aſſent: Hereby alſo you will have ſome conſiderable advantage to the exerciſe of all thoſe other affections, that muſt help to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and encreaſe the love of God in you, ſuch as are Repentance and Faith in Chriſt; for there you have the fulleſt diſcoveries of the odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, and the neceſſity of Repentance, and the Excellency of Chriſt and Faith in him, who took our Fleſh, and died for this very end, that he might reconcile God to us, and us to God, and recover our affections to him, that the world had abus'd and drawn away; and as the exerciſe of Repentance will promote the love of God in you, by mortifying that which is contrary to it; ſo Faith in Chriſt much more; for the more we love and ſubject our ſelves to him, who is the Wiſdome of the Father, and the higheſt pledge of his love to ſinful man, the more we are like to love the Father himſelf that both ſent him, and accepted the ſatisfaction that he offered to him in our behalf. And then laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the more we are exerciſed in the praiſes of God, the more we are exerciſed in love it ſelf; for this is an immediate effect of love.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:134641:158"/>
                  <p>So that it ſhould be one end of Conſideration to exerciſe and quicken thoſe affections: <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) <hi>Aſsent to the truth of Scripture.</hi> (2.) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world,</hi> and all its pleaſures, as it fights againſt God. (3.) <hi>Repentance for all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins,</hi> and preſent unfitneſs to the love and ſervice of God. (4.) <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> (5.) <hi>Love to God directly.</hi> (6.) <hi>Praiſe and thankfulneſs to him:</hi> Not that I exclude other ſimple or mixt affections, but becauſe I intend anon to give you ſome help for the better exerciſe of theſe particularly, which I intended at firſt for my own private uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it muſt be the end of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo to actuate and ſtrengthen theſe or ſome other holy affections towards God, and ſo to advance him in your heart; ſo it muſt be your laſt end to ſtrengthen your reſolution of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, both active and paſſive, and ſo to advance him in your life and practice. This ſhould and would be the laſt end of your daily Conſideration, if it be right: As it is Gods end when he requireth the <hi>Heart</hi> that he might have the <hi>Life</hi> alſo, for he knows that the life and practice will be ſuitable to the heart, which is the great Principle of them; ſo it muſt be our end alſo, in the exerciſe of our Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to promote the Kingdom of God in our heart, that we may the better honour him in our life. Remember therefore in the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this Duty, that you grow more reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Obedience: For as love to God will be the fruit of your Meditations, if they be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſo Obedience will be the fruit of your
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:134641:159"/>love, if it be ſincere: And as you are never like to do or ſuffer the Will of God with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and to grow in Obedience, unleſs you grow ſtronger in deliberate purpoſe and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo you are never like to grow in reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if you do not grow in the love of God.</p>

                  <head>Argument I.</head>
                  <p>THoſe Writings whoſe Pen-men were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and approved by God, muſt needs be of Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>But the Writings of the Old and New Teſtament had ſuch Pen-men. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Major Propoſition</hi> is beyond all doubt, and paſt diſpute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Minor Propoſition,</hi> (viz.) That the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Old and New Teſtament, were Men Authorized and approved by God in that very Work, is evident in that theſe Writers did atteſt and prove the Inſpiration they did pretend to by <hi>frequent, Reall, and uncontrouled Miracles,</hi> which none but God could enable them to do. For,</p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:134641:163"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> They were unqueſtionably above the power of meer Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe Writers thereof muſt derive their power from ſome inviſible Author, either Good or Bad: But from the Devil or any bad Spirit they could not. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some [at leaſt] of thoſe Miracles which were wrought by the Pen-men of the Old and New Teſtament were without the Spehre of all natural Cauſation, and were ſuch as no created Cauſe, or meer natural Agent can poſſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, by the meer ſtock of their own ſtrength. [Now the bad Spirits are no better than Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and can work no other waies but by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Efficiency and Cauſation, and therefore could not do ſome of theſe works.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such was the Raiſing of the Dead to Life, and the giving ſight to thoſe which were born perfectly blind.</hi> Not to inſtance in any other: [Though perchance to cure all ſorts of Diſeaſes, with a word, and in a moment, is more than the Devil can ſeemingly imitate, or any one can do, that hath not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from God.] Now the Rule is certain, <hi>A privatione ad habitum non datur Regreſſus natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter:</hi> [if the privation be Total:] <hi>Nam produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio totius entis, &amp; entis ex materiâ prorſus ineptâ,</hi> are the Specialties of God alone, and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives Royal annexed to his Crown, who hath ordained the conſtant courſe of Cauſes and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which we call <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Courſe of Nature,</hi> and hath made all thoſe Agents that work in that orderly Courſe [which we call <hi>Natural Cauſes.</hi>]</p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:134641:163"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the evil Spirits could do ſuch works as theſe [which yet they cannot, as hath been proved] yet it would be inconſiſtent with the infinite Wiſdom, Truth and Goodneſs, and the nature and being of that Government, which as ſupreme Rector of Mankind, he doth exerciſe, to ſuffer his Creatures to be thus deluded, and to leave Man under an Impoſſibility of ever attaining to the knowledge of his Will in a rational way, and by ſuch objective Evidence as may work conviction upon his own Faculties, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of others with whom he ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And yet if the Devil could do ſuch works, and God ſhould permit him [neither of) which can be as hath been made appear] yet it would not conſiſt with his own intereſt, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and credit ſuch Writers as theſe were, and to Confirm <hi>Such a Doctrin,</hi> that's ſo deſtructive to his nature, and that tends ſo viſibly to the overthrow of his Kingdom: For if Satan were thus divided and ſhould fight after this deſperate Manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, his Kingdom could not ſtand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.25. Which is the very ſtrength of our Saviours Argument when he was calumniated by the Jews to have wrought thoſe mighty works which he did by the Power of <hi>Belzebub:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly either the Devil himſelf muſt want that that's Eſſential to an Intelligent Being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Spirit and void utterly of all underſtanding; or elſe the man muſt, that can think the Devil would ſo effectually promote his own Downfal, and ſtrike ſuch a blow at the very Root of his own kingdom. For we ſee by Experience where this Doctrine is
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:134641:164"/>once received, the worſhip of Devils and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Arts, and impious Practices do forthwith va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: And the one true God is ſerved with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Devils. And the Doctrine of Chriſt, for Confirmation whereof theſe works were done, forbids us to worſhip Devils, and draws us away from all pollutions wherewith the evil Spirits are delighted: Whoſe power and Force was broken by Chriſt's coming as <hi>Porphyry</hi> himſelf acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; And therefore <hi>Origen, Arnob. Tertulian, Juſtin Martyr, Athanaſius, Clemens Alexandrinus Athen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras, Lactantius,</hi> with the reſt that dealt with the Heathens, do make the pure Excellency of Chriſts Doctrine above all other Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it promoteth Holineſs, and Juſtice, and order in the World, and ſtrongly oppoſeth all impious and unrighteous Practiſes in which the Devils are delighted, whereby their Kingdom is very much weakened, and in ſome places utterly ruined, one of the main Arguments for the Chriſtian Faith: Would the Devil ever ſet any ſeal, or give any confirming Teſtimony to ſuch Precepts as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that which he hateth, to ſuch Promiſes as encourage Men every where to hate and oppoſe him, to ſuch threatening, as tend exceedingly to diſcourage and bring to repentance all his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates? Would he helpon ſuch a Doctrine, that teacheth Men, What a filthy malicious Spirit he is, and from what a Happineſs he fell, and what a deſign he driveth on againſt God, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath the Face of Goodneſs, and how he hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Mankind, and would bring all Men into the ſame curſed condition with himſelf? Would he have Men know his devices leaſt he ſhould come
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:134641:164"/>upon them unawares? And would he have them abhor, and tremble at the mention of his very Name; Theſe are the effects that this Doctrin is like to have upon Mens Minds: And therefore, it's paſt doubt, that if the Devil could work Miracles, he would never do it in the preſent caſe, nor give the leaſt Countenance to ſuch writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>But if he were Maſter of ſuch a Seal, and had that Faculty, he would rather lend it to the Sects that ſeek to diſparage, undermine, and cry down theſe Writings in the World: He perfectly hateth that parity that runneth in every vein of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, which made <hi>Aeneas Sylv.</hi> ſay <hi>ut Plat. p.</hi> 328.</p>
                  <q>Chriſtiana Fides ſi Miraculis noneſſet approbata, Honeſtate ſuâ recipi debuit.</q>
                  <p>And therefore it would be a wonder indeed, if he ſhould do a Miracle to confirm it: The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles therefore that were wrought in Atteſtation of this Doctrine, never came from him: He had no more hand in the Miracles, than he had in the Doctrine they bore witneſs to, or than he would have in the overthrow of his own Kingdom: And therefore Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> Orig. Sac. l. 2.10. well makes it a Teſt, or Criterium of Miracles wrought by a Divine Power, where they tend to the overthrow of Satans Power in the World.</p>
                  <p>And this Argument taken from Miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with the Holy Doctrine which they ratifie and atteſt, is ſuch a demonſtration of the Truth of the Moſaical Religion before Chriſt, and to the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:134641:165"/>Chriſtian Religion ſince, that to attribute theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to the Devil, which could not poſſibly be wrought by any other Power than the Finger of the Holy-Ghoſt, is now commonly thought by the moſt learned and judicious Divines, to be, <hi>The Blaſphemy againſt the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. The unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin: Thus <hi>Athanaſius, Epiſcopus,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thought, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath demonſtratively ſhewed in his <hi>Treat. of Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The only Exception</hi> that can have any ſhew of Pretence to invalidate this Argument, is, that the matters of fact ſeem to be Queſtionable, (1) Some may poſſibly queſtion, whether ever ſuch Miracles were wrought to confirm the Scriptures? or whether ever there were ſuch a perſon as Chriſt that did ſuch Mighty works, that dyed and roſe again from the Dead, and poured forth a Holy and Miraculous Spirit upon his Followers, for the Conviction of Infidels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The matter of Fact can be queſtioned with no more Reaſon, than whether there be ſuch a City as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by the Perſons that never ſaw them: or whether there ever lived ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Julius</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar:</hi> For there is the ſame, or greater Evidence for THOSE, than theſe is for <hi>Theſe:</hi> But there is none that will queſtion theſe.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon is, becauſe this their Aſſent is grounded upon <hi>Two Principles</hi> that will not ſuffer any diſſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt is,</hi> It's impoſſible that ſo many Men in ſo many Ages ſhould meet or combine in a Lye, when they get nothing by their Lye, <hi>Nulla ratam
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:134641:165"/>teſtis debet habere,</hi> Ovid—<hi>ubi premia falſi ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond is,</hi> It's not poſſible the ſences of ſo many Men ſhould fail them, and that they ſhould all miſtake and be deluded, that were eye and Earwitneſſes of the matter of Fact, and both ſaw and heard the Authors of thoſe Writings, and the Miracles which they wrought to confirm them: See, <hi>Pet. Hart. de Mendozâ Phyſ. diſp.</hi> 8. <hi>de Animâ.</hi> Sect. 3. and Sect. 23.4, 5. pag. 570.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame Author to <hi>This Queſtion,</hi> what ſort of Evidence is that by which I believe that there is ſuch a place as <hi>Rome</hi> upon the witneſs of ſo many Men aſſerting it? <hi>Anſwereth,</hi> It is Phyſical: For it is impoſſible even in a Phyſical ſenſe, that ſo many Men in ſo many Ages ſhould [ſo] lye: ſo that I have no leſs Evidence that there is a City called <hi>Rome,</hi> than that all Fire is heating: Thus he, <hi>See Mr.</hi> Baxter's <hi>Spirits witneſs to the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, pag.</hi> 68.</p>
                  <p>The ſame or as infallible Phyſical Evidence have we of the Truth of the Miracles, by which the Holy-Ghoſt did witneſs to the Truth of the Chriſtian Faith: For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's naturally impoſſible that ſo many Churches, in ſo many Countries of the World, at ſuch a diſtance, ſhould combine to lye, in telling the world that the Holy-Ghoſt was given, and Tongues ſpoken, and Miracles done amongſt them, for ſo many Years, if it had not been ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man hath a Nature as well as a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and the underſtanding naturally enclines to Truth, and the will hath naturally, and of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity Good (as Good) for its object; And man
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:134641:166"/>as well as Brutes hath a Nature, that cannot but love it ſelf; and deſire its own wellfare, and abhor death and Miſery, Temporral and Eternal; And therefore tho here and there a Man in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Paſſion may make away himſelf, yet we are Phyſically certain, that it muſt be a thing which they do indeed believe, that muſt perſwade Cities, and Countries of People in their wits, to caſt their Eſtates and Lives into the Hands of Bloody Tyrants, and utterly ruin their worldly hopes: And eſpecially when they do all this in hope of a Bleſſedneſs in the Life to come: Where it is impoſſible that ſo many Men of Reaſon ſhould expect to be bleſſed, for conſpiring in a Lye; but rather to be everlaſtingly curſed and miſerable, by the juſtice of that God from whom they expect their Reward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I conclude,</hi> therefore that the Caſe being reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Mans Natural Principles, and inclinations ſo clearly as it is, There is natural Evidence of the Truth of theſe Miracles:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This infallible Certainty</hi> that we have (or may have) is grounded upon <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition</hi> whereby <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal]</hi> is not meant the Conſent of all Men, in the World [no more than all the world is meant by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Church) but that which is oppoſed to the <hi>Private Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and hath a certain Moral Univerſality, and is built as to the Certainty upon Common, natural, and rational Grounds, and not on the Romiſh pretended Authority, or Infallibility, <hi>See Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>Pref. to his Book of Infidelity.</hi>

                     <hi>And for the</hi> 2d. (1) <hi>The courſe that they took,</hi> It was the certain way to ruin themſelves and all their hopes in this world: Before they undertook this work, they were told by Chriſt their Maſter, that they muſt be his Martyrs, and bear witneſs to the Doctrine they were to preach by the Loſs of their Credit, Liberty and Lives: And is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would ever venture upon ſuch a deſign, if they had not good Security, that they ſhould be no loſers in the End, and that the Cauſe they managed was Gods, who would infallibly ſucceed and reward them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And for the</hi> 3d. (1) <hi>The Doctrine they were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and plant</hi>) It was perfectly contrary to the Nature and Inclination of thoſe, that were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; and would certainly expoſe them to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in the world, and make them the ſcorn and reproach of all Unbelievers [which at this time was all the world, except a few inconſiderable Idiots.</p>
                  <p>The very <hi>Firſt Elements</hi> of this Doctrine, were ſo croſs and diſpleaſing to fleſh and Blood (which before this Doctrine was received, ruled all the world,) that without the concurring mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, It was plainly impoſſible, that it ſhould be entertained: For Men to deny themſelves, and to take up their Croſs and follow Chriſt, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to profeſs themſelves his diſciples and glory in his Name, who was ſo deſpiſed and hated of all Men: To renounce the fleſh with its Affections and Luſts: To love their enemies, and heartily to ſeek the wellfare of thoſe that ſeek their hurt, and rejoyce in their Calamity: To live as ſtrangers and Pilgrims in the world, having their only delight
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:134641:168"/>and treaſure above; And to deſpiſe the world, and all its glory as it draws away the Heart from God: To prefer reproach and affliction with the people of God, before the pleaſures of ſin which are but for a ſeaſon; And to chuſe heartily to be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the Houſe of God, and to have the meaneſt Office in his Service, before the moſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Palaces of vanity and wickedneſs, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Honour in any other Service: To lay all down at the Feet of his Maker and Redeemer, with the moſt humble ſubmiſſion, being ready to part with the deareſt and neareſt Comforts, when the Lord would have it ſo: In a word, to be wholly at his beck, in an Active and Paſſive Obedience: Theſe are Doctrins plain and eaſie to be underſtood, but hard of digeſtion, that grate hard upon the Fleſh. And yet theſe were the very <hi>Eſſentials of Chriſtianity,</hi> which they were to proclaim and command Men in the Name of God with all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to receive: And to threaten deſtruction from the Lord to all Refuſers. How unlikely was this Doctrin to take with Fleſh and Blood, unleſs it were accompanied with power from above.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And for the fourth,</hi> (viz.) <hi>The mighty oppoſition that it met with,</hi> even all the Potentates on Earth, the Kings and great Men, the wiſe Men and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the Statiſts and Polititians, counted this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God meer fooliſhneſs: And therefore it was the great objection, that the Infidels and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens aſſaulted the Doctrin of Chriſt with, that none but the rude Multitude became his Diſciples and Followers (though afterwards <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagite, Polycarp, Juſtin, Irenaeus,</hi> and learned <hi>Origen,</hi> quite ſpoiled the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Hopes, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:134641:168"/>undid this fooliſh Objection; For they ſaw that it was not want of Learning that made them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: For <hi>Origen</hi> had ſo much, that the moſt learned <hi>Plotinus,</hi> ſeeing him amongſt his Auditors bluſh'd, and after a few words abruptly brake off his Lecture;) And you know it was the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> Objection againſt Chriſt, Have any of the Rulers believed on him? But theſe People that know not the Law, (meaning thoſe that embraced Chriſts Doctrin) are accuſed: <hi>John</hi> 7.48, 49. Yea the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, whom God had ſo much obliged to himſelf, by ſo many remarkable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, were filled with bitter Indignation and Malice, and did fiercely perſecute all that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Doctrin, and wanted neither Spight, nor Zeal, nor Opportunity, to cruſh all that went this way, and to bring heavy ſufferings upon them: Moreover [which was the grand Impediment of all to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi>] there were then ſuch ſwarms of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (1.) Such as profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but hated it in their hearts, and did their utmoſt to root it up: And yet it proſpered before their Faces, whilſt they ſtood and looked on, gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Teeth, and fretting. That naked, ſimple, and illiterate Men ſhould prevail againſt all manner of weapons that were in their hands to ruin and deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>All which laid together is no leſs than a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of a Divine and Almighty Power in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſuch an unlikely Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> And as it was at firſt <hi>planted</hi> by no leſs than a Divine Power, ſo the ſame mighty Aſſiſtance was neceſſary, and therefore obſervable in its <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation:</hi> It was impoſſible that ſuch a Doctrin
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:134641:169"/>ſhould ſpread and ſubdue the World to its obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (as it quickly did) unleſs infinite wiſdom and power had made way, and bleſſed it: How could it have got ſo much ground, and have run ſo ſwiftly thorough the World, if he that rideth upon a Cherub, and flyeth upon the wings of the wind (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.10.) had not carried it? In the ſpace of <hi>Thirty Years,</hi> or thereabouts (as appears by uncontrouled Hiſtory) it ſpread it ſelf far and near, not only in <hi>Judea,</hi> and all <hi>Aſia,</hi> yea thorough the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but beyond it alſo; It ſounded in the Ears of <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Indians:</hi> It ſhot it ſelf like Lightning thorough the places where it made its progreſs, and melted Mens Hearts, whilſt their Bodies were untouched. Though it was ſuch an Enemy to the Pride, Pomp and Glory of the World, which it was purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to diſparage, that it might make way for a deſpiſed, crucified Chriſt, to reign in the Earth, yet it ſoon got into the Courts of Princes, and into the Conſiſtories of Sage and Wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, and into the Academies of Learning, and prevailed over all oppoſing power: yea, the more it was cut and wounded, the more it grew up and ſhot forth: <gap reason="foreign">

As for the Religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> it's no wonder that ſuch a carnal Fleſh-pleaſing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, that doth ſo highly gratifie the Luſts of Men, ſhould ſo take with them, and quickly ſpread it ſelf, eſpecially when it had ſo many Advantages of Power and Policy to diffuſe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fire and Sword</hi> were the Arguments that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> uſed to ſupport his Cauſe and to encreaſe his Followers: But Chriſt took a quite contrary courſe and very unlikely to ſucceed, but that it had the Countenance and Approbation of Him who knew well enough how to proſper it with a mighty ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: With which ſince the Chriſtian Cauſe hath been ſo miraculouſly bleſſed, it's a Proof beyond exception, that God hath owned it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Scriptures that contain this Doctrin, were inſpired by God, becauſe they lay claim to ſuch inſpiration, and pretend to be the Word of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: This is more than ſufficient to prove in the <hi>General</hi> God's Approbation of the whole Scripture.</p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:134641:170"/>
                  <p>But yet more <hi>particularly:</hi> Conſider how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of this Word have been fulfilled and made good in all Ages and Succeſſions of the Church: And this will manifeſt that God hath owned this Doctrin <hi>ex ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti:</hi> After his Predictions concerning his own Death and Suffering, and the Manner, together with the Means and Inſtruments of it were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and that he was Crucified by his own Country-men, and mocked and ſpit upon, and numbred amongſt Tranſgreſſors, his Garments parted, his ſide pierced, and ſuch like circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces punctually fulfilled, according as he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told; and that he was riſen the Third Day, and had ſhewed himſelf openly to his Diſciples, for their encouragement and the ſtrengthning of their Faith, and that he had aſcended to Heaven in their ſight; He promiſed, that he would ſend the Holy Ghoſt, and endue them with power from above, to work Miracles, and to ſpeak with Tongues: which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was accordingly fulfilled; For on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when they were aſſembled at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which other Hiſtories, as well as the Sacred, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and none contradict: He promiſed alſo his extraordinary Power and Preſence with them, and wonderful ſucceſs; and all came to paſs in like manner: He threatneth the hardning of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> And were they not accordingly affected? Moreover, he promiſed Bleſſing and Peace to the diligent obſervers of his Statutes: And have not many remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences made good this Word of Promiſe? With what joy and inward comfort unutterable have the faithful Servants of Chriſt triumphed in
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:134641:170"/>their very ſufferings: Many of the Martyrs that have ſealed the Truth of Chriſt with their very Blood have ſung at the Stake, and have profeſſed an inward raviſhment of Spirit, I, and that Men of a grave and diſcreet and no Fanatical credulous Spirit! Inſtances might be produced in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Mahomet</hi> now, or any other Religion whatſoever, produce as good Teſtimony for the Truth of their Religion if they can, as what is here produced, to declare the Approbation, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Favour of God to this Religion, which Chriſt taught, and his Followers embraced, and maintained to the death: And although God doth not daily ſhew forth theſe confirming Signs and Tokens of Chriſtianity, or that Religion which Chriſt in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> hath taught, both by his Mouth, and Example, yet ſometimes he is pleaſed to give ſuch clear and convincing Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Tokens of his Approbation, not liable to any exception, that they might be for ſtanding Monuments to others ever after: And ſuch as will not acknowledge them, but either take them for Fables, or aſcribe them to Chance or Fortune, and act their wickedneſs in defiance of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ſuch Perſons God meets with now and then even ſtill, to vindicate the Credit of thoſe former Stories, and to reinforce their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <p>I could run over the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> which is the ſum and ſubſtance of the Divine Laws contained in the Scripture, and ſhew you how God hath remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably puniſhed the more notable and famous Tranſgreſſours of all theſe Laws, and the contempt
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:134641:171"/>of the Book in which theſe Laws are contained, and the deriſion of his Meſſengers, which he hath ordained, to proclame and expound theſe Laws; and to provoke and perſwade Men to the hearty obſervance of them: It would be an endleſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to produce all the Inſtances that are to be found in credible Authors of this kind.</p>

                     <p>IS Mentioned in the 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold there came a Man of God out of</hi> Judah, <hi>by the command of the Lord unto</hi> Bethel, <hi>and</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam <hi>ſtood by the Altar to offer Incenſe: And he cryed against the Altar in the Word of the Lord, and ſaid, O Altar! Altar! thus ſaith the Lord, Behold a Child ſhall be born of the Houſe of</hi> David, Joſiah <hi>by Name, and upon thee ſhall he offer the Prieſts of the High Places, that burn Incenſe upon thee, and Mens bones ſhall be burnt on thee.</hi> This was more than 300 years before <hi>Joſiah</hi> was born;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:134641:173"/>And this was regiſtred preſently according to the Manner of thoſe Times, and the Miracles that happened about the Fact: As that the Altar cleft in twain: And that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſtretching forth his hand to apprehend him, had his hand withered, until it was reſtored by the Man of God's Prayers.</p>
                     <p>There paſſed 300 <hi>years</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> was born, and came to reign in <hi>Judah,</hi> and one day coming to <hi>Bethel,</hi> to overthrow the Altar, and to deſtroy the Sepulchers of thoſe Idolatrous Prieſts, lit upon the Tomb where the Man of God was buried, with the Superſcription upon it, which he left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, as is declared 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.15, 16, 17. Never was there any Nation upon the Earth, that can produce ſuch Propheſies as theſe: ſo certain, ſo particular, ſo long foretold before the time, and ſo exactly fulfilled.

                     <head>The next Prophecy</head>
                     <p>IS recorded of <hi>Cyrus, Eſaiah</hi> 44.28. foretold 200 years before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was born, when there was not the leaſt probability of ſuch a thing: He ſaith to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> thou art my Shepherd, and he ſhall perform all my deſire; ſaying alſo to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thou ſhalt be built, and to the Temple, thy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be ſurely laid, all which was punctually fulfilled by <hi>Cyrus, Ezra</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that there might be no poſſible ſuſpition of Forgery in this Matter. This Book of <hi>Eſaiah</hi> was pronounced openly to the People, as other Propheſies were, and publiſhed into many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:134641:173"/>hands before the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> fell out; and then carried alſo with the People, and diſperſed in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and other parts of the World.</p>
                     <p>A vaſt number of theſe Propheſies may be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered up in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> though the Inſtances already produced are all out of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> Theſe Inſtances, with many other better improved, you may find in <hi>Parſons Reſolut.

                     <p>Yet, <hi>to conclude this Argument,</hi> Let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how punctually Chriſt foretold what ſhould befall himſelf from his own Countrey-Men, and ſome of his Diſciples; How he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, betrayed, and put to death, yea the death of the Croſs, and that he ſhould riſe again the third day: That the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be poured forth on his Diſciples at the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> and often told thoſe that diſcourſed with him the Thoughts of their Hearts, and what they would do, and did exactly predict the Deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their City and Temple, which accordingly fell out. And then let it be conſidered, what God ſaith in 41 <hi>Eſai.</hi> 22. wherein God provoketh the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to make proof of their Divinity, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Let them ſhew unto us, what ſhall happen; Let them ſhew the former things, what they be, that we may conſider them, and know the latter end of them, or declare us things for to come; ſhew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods:</hi> Intimating that it is a ſufficient proof of a Deity, to foreſhew what is to come when the thing is meerly contingent.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>FIrſt,</hi> From the Antiquity of theſe Books; <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us in his Second Book againſt <hi>Appion,</hi> That their Law-giver (he means <hi>Moſes</hi>) was more Antient than all the Law-givers that are mentioned in Antiquity: And that <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and all thoſe that <hi>Greece</hi> wonders at, are but Novices, and of much later ſtanding, compared unto him: and St. <hi>Auſtin, De Civit. Dei, l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 37. In the days of ſome of our Prophets, the Gentile Philoſophers were not in being: yea, the Seven wiſe Men of <hi>Greece;</hi> and thoſe Secretiſts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that were of a higher date, <hi>Anaximander, Anaximenes,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras;</hi> neither were they ſo antient as ſome of our Prophets. They were far more antient than the oldeſt Hiſtoriographers among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Helanicus, Herodotus, Pherecydes, Thucydides, Xenophon:</hi> And albeit the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had ſome Poets before, as <hi>Orpheus, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Heſiod,</hi> yet the eldeſt of theſe arrived no higher, than the days of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was 500 years after <hi>Moſes,</hi> the firſt Pen-Man of the Bible.</p>
                  <p>Along time after this moſt of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Gods were unborn, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> themſelves in their Genealogies of them do confeſs.

                  <p>The oldeſt Hiſtories extant, beſide the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Bible, are about the <hi>Theban</hi> Wars, and the Funerals of <hi>Troy,</hi> as <hi>Lucretius</hi> intimates in theſe Verſes;

                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Argument</hi> may be drawn from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men that wrote them, who were ſuch as in no reaſon can be ſuſpected of Deceit or Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: They were plain, ſimple, honeſt Men, and ſuch as had the Approbation of their Enemies, for their innocent Life and Converſation: They were never accuſed of any Fault, charged with any Crime, except that they taught a Doctrin quite contrary to the Manners and Practices, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And this ſtirred up their Rage and Malice againſt them; and being ſo provoked, you may be ſure they ſpake the worſt they could of them: And if they could have found any thing to alledge againſt them, you ſhould have heard it again and again: They had Enemies enough that lay at watch to diſcredit their Teſtimony, if they had been able; that ſo they might have hindred the further growth of that Religion that ſo much croſſed their worldly ends: They could not hope to compaſs any worldly Intereſt, or get any temporal Advantage, by ſuch a Courſe as this; Nay rather, they were ſure to bring all the World about their Ears, and to undo
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:134641:175"/>themſelves thereby: And they expected no leſs, but were ready to venture their Lives upon the Credit of this Word which they proclaimed open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the World, and preached boldly to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Enemies, that threatned them with the greateſt Cruelties: The Teſtimony they gave to our Saviour's Divinity, and miraculous Acts, they ſtood to, and boldly defended, to the very Face of the bloody <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> that murthered him, whilſt they had ſpight enough in their hearts, and power in their hands to put them to death, and gnaſhed upon them with their Teeth: Had they intended by Forgery to advance themſelves in the World, they would have taken a more likely Courſe, and curried Favour with the great Ones of the World, that had it in their power to gratifie their deſires, and they would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a lye more to their own advantage. It's the manner of Impoſtors and thoſe that love lying, to contrive nothing ſooner, than that which they think will be moſt grateful to their Hearers. True, ſome of them were Fiſhermen, and if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had fiſh'd for themſelves, they would have baited their Hooks with ſuch things as they knew the Fiſhes lik'd, and not with ſuch things as would drive the Fiſh away: They would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated their Words to the tickling of their Ears, and the ſatisfying of their Luſts. But they knew it was not their own Word which they preached, but the Word of God, and therefore it muſt not be falſified for any Mens pleaſure: And therefore they deſpiſed Pleaſures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned both the Hatred and Kindneſs of Men, and expoſed themſelves to the bittereſt Sufferings,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:134641:175"/>rather than conceal it from the World: What place is here for the leaſt ſuſpition of untruth? Now in Matter of Fact, as <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, we ought verily to ſtand to unſuſpected Teſtimonies: And if as <hi>Ovid</hi> affirms,
<q>
                        <l>—<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi praemia Falſi</l>
                        <l>Nulla ratam Teſtis debet habere fidem.</l>
                     </q> How much more authentick is the Teſtimony, when it hath no Reward, but the bittereſt uſage that enraged Malice can bring about?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Argument</hi> may be taken from the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Conſent, and perpetual uniſon Agreement of all the Writers of theſe Sacred Doctrins: The witneſs of Lyers would vary, and never come up to a perfect uniſon and Agreement. But now there is one even Thread runs thorough all the Parts of Scripture, not at all divided, or entangled, or rather one and the ſame Spirit animates the whole, and quickens every the leaſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Though to unſtudied Men that have not made exact and diligent ſearch into them, there may ſeem to be ſome Contradiction, yet Men that have div'd into them, and have made the deepeſt ſearch, have fairly reconciled all theſe ſeeming Repugnancies, and have put to ſilence all Gain-ſayers: and it is no more than all Writings are liable to, though they be never ſo conform and agreeable to themſelves, yet they may ſeem to claſh to an injudicious Reader.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:134641:176"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Argument</hi> may be taken from the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Continuance of theſe Writings in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all that have endeavoured to ſuppreſs them: They had certainly periſhed in the Flames long before now, if God had not walked in the midſt of Fire with them. How did the <hi>Jews</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperours on the other, conſpire both to root out the Men, and the Doctrin, which they publiſhed and taught? You know what General Perſecutions there have been at once of all the Chriſtians throughout the World, and how many Thouſands have been ſlaughtered by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours Commands. I need not tell you that there were Ten of theſe General Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and yet all would not do. <hi>Julian</hi> ſtrictly prohibited all <hi>Chriſtian Schools,</hi> thinking by that Means to root Chriſtianity out of the World: and yet the Succeſs was not anſwerable to his Malice. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> commanded all the Holy Writings ſhould be burnt, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> will inform you, 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 1.59. yet God preſerved them. And <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> Author of the <hi>Tenth Perſecution,</hi> commanded by Proclamation, the Holy Scriptures to be burnt where ever they were found throughout the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire; as <hi>Euſeb.</hi> relates, <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 3. If the Scriptures had not been the Word of God, they had never ſurviv'd ſo much Malice and the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Endeavours of ſo many ſubtil and potent Enemies to deſtroy them out of the World; nor eſcap'd the combined furious Attempts both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to blot them out of the Memory of Mankind.</p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:134641:176"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover,</hi> If all that were hitherto produced, were not enough to demonſtrate the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, and to ſatisfie and confirm the Mind in this weighty Truth, I might add by way of <hi>Accumulation,</hi> other <hi>Proofs</hi> from the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Purity, and Efficacy of this Word, which ſo far excels all Humane Writings in theſe particulars: And alſo from the Profeſſion of Men and Martyrs, that did and were ready to dye for it; Men of great Parts and Integrity, that would not have parted with their Lives without a ſufficient Cauſe: As alſo from the deſtruction of the Grand Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it: And the Conſent of ſo many Men in all Ages, and thoſe that had the greateſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages throughly to ſcan and know the Truth, and the Aſſent of very Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>All which do prove <hi>ex ſuper abundanti,</hi> that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the moſt</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sacred Word of God,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>and Written by</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Divine Inſpiration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore with ſome little Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in a Point of ſuch Weight and Moment; Remember in your Meditations, to ſtrengthen this <hi>Intellectual Grace,</hi> which lies in the Firm and Active Belief of the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> Get and keep ſuch Clear Evidence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of its <hi>Divinity,</hi> that may ſatisfie
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:134641:177"/>your Soul, and enforce the moſt practical Aſſent: That you may read the Threatnings with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and a ſuitable Fear, as thoſe that God will certainly make good and execute upon thoſe that fall under them: That you may read the Promiſes with full perſwaſion of their Accompliſhment to thoſe that have their part and intereſt in them, and ſo feel the forcible power of them to quicken you to your Duty: That you may read the Precepts, not as idle Storys, but as the Commands of God: Look that you evidently ſee the Name of God upon the Doctrin and Hiſtory thereof, and it will have another Effect, than a bare opinionative or implicit belief, grounded upon the bare word of Man, could produce. Your Aſſent will be ſuitable to your Evidence; and the Effect and Influence it hath upon your Heart and Life, will be ſuitable to your Aſſent. It's time well ſpent, to read over and conſider thoſe Treatiſes that convince the Divine Authority of Scripture. The better the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is laid, the more firm will the Superſtructure be. When once thou art ſolidly and throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that God is the Author of the Scriptures, thou wilt expect a Treaſure there, that is not to be found in any Humane Writings, any farther than they contain this Doctrin in them. If you delight in Falſhood and Lyes, and love Darkneſs rather than Light, ſearch not here, nor expect that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould gratifie you: But if thou art a Lover of Truth, a Lover of Wiſdom, then come hither, and dig into theſe Mines, and God that was the Author will open thine Eyes, if thou truly deſire to be informed.</p>

               <p>BEfore I come to the <hi>Motives</hi> that ſhould ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us to the frequent and delightful Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>Faith,</hi> which muſt be daily kept in the Mind and Thoughts, (or ſome of the like Nature) it's neceſſary that we well underſtand the Nature of that Faith which is of ſuch daily Uſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Advantage in the whole Chriſtian Life.</p>
               <p>For the better and more diſtinct Underſtanding whereof, we muſt take notice, that in the Word of God we are informed of a Twofold Kingdom of God. 1. The Firſt, as Creatour. 2. The Second, as Redeemer; And both theſe have their different Conſtitution and Adminiſtration. Whilſt Man ſtood in his Integrity, he was under the Laws and Government of his Creatour, and then
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:134641:178"/>Faith in God as his Creatour and Sovereign, was the Radical and Fundamental Virtue, which whilſt it did continue firm and inviolate, he was happy in the Favour of God; and never began to fail in his Obedience, till firſt his Faith and Heart ſubjection to God was ſhaken: But when his Heart began ſecretly to revolt from God, and to haeſitate about the perfect Veracity, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Goodneſs of God, and to believe the Tempter before him, (who is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) then he began to tranſgreſs and violate his Command.</p>
               <p>And having made Shipwreck of Faith and a good Conſcience towards God his Sovereign, that Law or Covenant which he had broken, threatens him with Eternal Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with pity towards lapſed Mankind, did not execute the deſerved Penalty; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a way in his Infinite Wiſdom, in which he might ſhew Mercy to his miſerable Creature Man, upon honourable Terms, and vindicate the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Law, and the Authority of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and make Tranſgreſſion as odious, as if the whole Species of Mankind had ſuffered, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law: And that was by the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God the Son, taking our Fleſh upon him, and uniting it to his Godhead, and ſo both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine Nature being united in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he might by the one be made capable of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and by the other, of ſatisfying, offended Juſtice. Thus God the Son, and our deareſt Saviour, undertook the Work, liv'd in an exact Conformity to the Law, fulfill'd all Righteouſneſs, and ſuffered what was due for our Tranſgreſſions, and having finiſhed the Work, God the Father was
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:134641:179"/>ſo well pleaſed therewith, that he alters the ſtate of things, and commits all into the hands of his Son, and now the Second Kingdom commenceth, which is the <hi>Kingdom of God as Redeemer,</hi> as the <hi>other was of God as Creator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here the Conſtitution and Government is quite different from the former: The former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Faith in God, and Perfect Obedience, upon the Penalty of Eternal Death, if there was the leaſt Violation.</p>
               <p>The latter requireth Repentance and Faith in Chriſt as Sovereign Redeemer, and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, continued to the End, or elſe threatneth a heavier Condemnation than the former: Here Faith in God the Redeemer conſtitutes us Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Second Kingdom, which is nothing elſe but Heart-Subjection to our Sovereign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as Faith in God was our Heart-Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our Sovereign Creatour; or elſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Conſent of the Soul to come under the Yoke and Government of Chriſt. So that the Faith which puts the Chriſtian into a Juſtified State is a Political Act, ſuch a one as he performs to a Prince that firſt conſents to be his Subject; (1.) to do the Duties of a Subject, if he may but enjoy the Priviledges and Immunities of ſuch a Subject. So that Faith is no one Phyſical Act of the Underſtanding or Will, but is made up of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Acts of both.</p>
               <p>It ſuppoſeth our knowledge of God the Second Perſon in the Trinity, ſuffering and ſatisfying in our Nature, and God's acceptance, and a full pardon granted to all that repenting them of their Sin and Rebellion againſt God their Creatour, conſent
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:134641:179"/>heartily to come under the Sovereignty of God Redeemer, and to obey him in ſincerity all the days of their Life; It ſuppoſeth that we believe thus much, and that he is able to ſubdue our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and to bring us into favour with God again, and thereupon give ear, hearty conſent, reſigning up our ſelves in a deliberate Covenant unto him: This is the Faith which in the Goſpel is ſaid to juſtifie. By which deſcription of Faith, you may ſee that Faith <hi>Negatively</hi> is not</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Perſwaſion, that we are juſtified; for that would infer that a Man is juſtified, before he is juſtified, which Doctrin is ſo notoriouſly abſurd, that now I think Few or None own it: You may ſee it ſolidly confuted by ſeveral Arguments in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Anſwer to Serjeant <hi>Shephard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is it a bare Belief that Chriſt died for Sinners, and hath ſatisfied the Divine Juſtice. The Devil may have ſuch a Faith as this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor is it an Affyance to Recumbency upon Chriſt for pardon: The middlemoſt is an Act antecedent to juſtifying Faith, and the other Two are conſequent upon it, though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately it may be; at leaſt the firſt: For that ſometimes comes a long time after, when the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is grown up to a ſtate of ſtrength and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in his Faith, and ſometimes it never follows at all in many weak Believers. But <hi>Poſitively</hi> it is</p>
               <p>The weary Sinner's acceptance of Chriſt, as his Soveraign, to Rule, Sanctifie, and Save him, and the Souls deliberate ſubjecting it ſelf to him as his moſt endeared Lord and Governour, the abſolute Prieſt and Prophet, and one every way able to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:134641:180"/>ſave thoſe that are his true Subjects and Diſciples. This is the Univerſal, Radical and Fundamental Grace of the Goſpel, that diffuſeth its Virtue into all parts of the Chriſtian Life, and its weakneſs or ſtrength will be ſeen and felt in all our Chriſtian Duties.</p>
               <p>For the deeper radification and confirmation of this Grace therefore, it's neceſſary that we keep thoſe Reaſons continually upon our Minds, that are apt to produce or ſtrengthen it, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ponder them with our moſt ſerious Thoughts, that they may put us upon the Practice and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this univerſal Grace, till it grow up to the higheſt Perfection we are able. Thoſe that I ſhall ſuggeſt are ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> You will never prize nor exerciſe that Life of Faith, till you have well conſidered the Miſeries of an Unbeliever. It's impoſſible now to conceive, much more to expreſs, their intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable greatneſs; None can throughly underſtand what they are, but thoſe that feel them: Wo to the Perſon that comes thus to underſtand them! But ſuch aſſuredly will all thoſe be that die in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>Let me make a <hi>Brief Enumeration</hi> of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They continue in flat Rebellion againſt God, and how ſuch are like to ſpeed, I leave you to judge: We are all born with a rebellious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt God, and practice nothing but Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Contradiction to him, till this Nature be changed: ſhall God proclaim Pardon, Mercy, and Grace, to Conquer the Violence of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temptation, to thoſe that will lay down
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:134641:180"/>their Weapons of Rebellion, and give over their ſtubborn oppoſition againſt God, and come under the Command and Government of his Son? And ſhall you and I reject ſuch a gracious Offer, and ſay with thoſe Rebels, <hi>We will not have this Man to reign over us: (i. e.)</hi> We will not believe in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14. Nay hath Chriſt done ſo much to endear his Perſon and Government to us, treading the Wine-Preſs of his Father's wrath for us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3. ſhedding his warmeſt Blood to purchaſe our Peace with God? And ſhall we refuſe to ſubmit our ſelves to him? Is it he, or we, that are the gainers? Should he glory in ſuch poor contemptible Subjects, or we in ſuch an Almighty Sovereign and Saviour? We miſtake infinitely, and apprehend not the Matter aright, if we do not take it for a high Priviledge and Favour, to be under the Conduct of ſuch a one that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Wiſdom to Rule us, infinite Power both to protect us, and break our Enemies in pieces, and is not profited by our Service, <hi>Job</hi> 22.2. Can a Man be profitable to God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable to himſelf? Thou oweſt thy hearty Subjection unto God, He made thee, and is thy rightful and abſolute Sovereign, and when thou hadſt turn'd Traitor to him, He hath not ſet thee up as a Monument of his terrible Wrath and Vengeance: But hath laid the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his Son, ſo nearly allied to us, by the Aſſumption of our Nature, and relaxed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his Law; promiſing to accept ſincere Service and Love, though perfect Obedience be due: O what a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Aggravation will this be of our Sin, if we ſtill continue it after the Grace of God
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:134641:181"/>hath ſo much abounded towards us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. and perſiſt in our Rebellion: we know too well what it is to be Rebels againſt God our Redeemer; but we little imagin what it is to be ſentenced and condemned for Rebels at the great and terrible Day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Every Unbeliever hath the Guilt of all his former Sins faſt bound upon him: not one of them is pardoned; every Commiſſion, yea and every Omiſſion, every idle Thought, and Word and Action, with all their ſeveral Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, ſtand ſtill upon Record uncancell'd; God hath paſs'd an Act of Indempnity and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, and proclaimed wonderful Grace and Mercy to penitent Sinners; but the Unbeliever, whilſt ſuch, hath no ſhare nor portion in it. The Blood of Chriſt hath infinite virtue to cleanſe ſinners from all unrighteouſneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. but it's only ſuch as do believe: The Law of God the Creatour, or Covenant of Works, which threatneth Death to every Sin, is ſtill in Force to ſuch as are not the ſincere Subjects of Chriſt by Faith: the wrath of God abideth upon ſuch. <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on the Son hath everlaſting life; and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Every violation of the Law makes it due to the ſinner, and Faith in Chriſt is the only means to remove it; but where that is wanting, there it continues and abides. If one ſin unpardoned, will ſink the Soul of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour into everlaſting condemnation, into what unſpeakable miſery and horrour will that vaſt Number that he hath committed force the ſinner, who will not come unto Chriſt, nor ſubmit himſelf
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:134641:181"/>to his Redeemer? Look to thy ſelf, and anſwer it as thou canſt, that wilt not come unto Chriſt to be thy Advocate and anſwer for thee: ſtand upon thy own Legs as well as thou art able, that wilt not bottom thy ſelf by Faith on Chriſt: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſtorm of God's wrath as well as thou canſt, that wilt not anchor thy Soul upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the World. Thou ſeeſt the worſt of it, if thou canſt make light of it, it's but bearing all the Sins thou haſt committed upon thy own Body and Soul, and the Wrath of God due to them; And if thou takeſt this to be a tolerable and a light Burden, continue ſtill in thy unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If thou art no true Subject of Chriſt by Faith in him, thou art a Slave of Satan, and a Vaſſal to thine own Corruption: There are but two principal Maſters; Chriſt is one, whoſe Right it is; And Satan is the other, though an Uſurper; If thou wilt not devote thy ſelf to him, who is thy lawful Lord and Maſter, thou wilt be under the Commands of a Cruel Tyrant. There are but two Generals, Chriſt the Captain of our Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and Satan the Ring-leader to deſtruction; and one thou muſt fight under. There are but two ſorts of Servants; either thou art the Servant of Righteouſneſs, or elſe thou art the Servant of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. If Chriſt do not dwell in thy Heart by Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. Satan hath got poſſeſſion, and thou art a Member of that wicked Spirit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (1.) that efficaciouſly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Children of Diſobedience, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. He formeth thy Conceptions, frameth thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:134641:182"/>animateth all thy Actions, ſteereth thy whole Converſation, and when there is need, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigateth thee to any Wickedneſs: though thou art ſecure and little ſuſpecteſt, 'tis he that prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee in all thou goeſt about. If thou hadſt an eye to ſee what influence he hath upon all thy Actions, it would make thee to abhor all thou doeſt. Indeed there are wicked Habits and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that ſtrongly move and hurry thee into the ſame wickedneſs which the Devil would have thee to commit; for if thou wert meerly paſſive, it would be thy Miſery, but not thy Sin: But now having no part in Chriſt, thou art at once led by thy own Corruption, and the Enemy of all Goodneſs, into all Sin and Miſchief. No <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlavery comparable to this, wherein the ſinner is wounding and tearing, and wracking himſelf every day, and yet though he feels the ſmart, ſometime perceives the miſchief he doth himſelf, he cannot, nor will forbear. You would look with pity upon a Madman, gnaſhing and cutting himſelf, and bleſs God that you are ſober, when you ſee the pernicious Effects of Madneſs: And yet if you are impenitent unbelievers, you are guilty of far worſe Cruelty to your Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If thou art a Unbeliever, thou art not ſure to be one Day longer out of Hell, and Eternal Miſery: thou hangſt over the Pit of Deſtruction, by the ſingle Thread of thy Life; and if the Twine break, (as it is a Miracle it doth not every hour) all the World cannot ſave thee: Let not a deceived Heart turn thee aſide, that thou canſt not by Faith in Chriſt deliver thy own Soul, nor ſay, is there not a Lye in my Right
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:134641:182"/>Hand? <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44.2. Thy Riches and thy Honours cannot prevent thy Death, much leſs can they procure a Releaſe from it, leaſt of all can they Ranſom thee from Deſtruction; thou art haſting to it every Moment, and thou knoweſt not what one Day or Hour may bring forth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. As ſure as thou liveſt, ſo ſurely thou ſhalt dye for ever, (if thou go forward in unbelief) when once thy Breath is departed from thy Body, and how many ways that may be ſtop'd, who knows? And wilt thou yet ſtand out againſt the gracious Offers of thy Redeemer, and linger in Infidelity, and run the hazard of Eternal Deſtruction? Nay, its no hazard, but as undoubtedly certain, as the Word of God is true. O that unbelievers would ponder this, that they would but conſider their latter End, what a few Breaths more they have to fetch before they are turned into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſpair: How dare you lye down to ſleep, leſt you ſhould awake in Hell? How dare you riſe, leſt it ſhould be to Judgment and Condemnation? How can you enjoy your Life one Moment, that know not but that the next Moment you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change it for Endleſs Torment and Miſery; And how will you do to give up the Ghoſt, that have not given up your Names to Chriſt? Your fooliſh Friends may flatter you, and your own fraudulent Heart may cheat you, but the Word of God tells you plainly what will be your doom, if by Faith in Chriſt you do not eſcape it: How can you do to read ſuch a Text as that in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <gap reason="foreign">

But whither wilt thou fly when God purſues? What will you do in the day of viſitation, and in the deſolation which ſhall come from far? To whom will you fly for help? ſaith the Prophet to the wicked <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that had provoked God to be their Enemy, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 10.3. There's no flying from him: Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there; If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there; If I take
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:134641:183"/>the wings of the Morning, and dwell in the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy hand lead me, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 130.7, 8, 9, 10. There's no eſcaping his hand; If he come to tare in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there can be none to deliver, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.22.</p>
               <p>Stay a little, thou that art an impenitent unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and conſider a while what this importeth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To have God for thine Adverſary.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> All the Creatures will ſet againſt thee firſt or laſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thine own Conſcience ſhall ſide with God againſt thee, and to make thee perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerable, ſhall fall upon thee with the greateſt Fury and Madneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thou reject the gracious Offers of Mercy by the Goſpel, and refuſe to have Chriſt reign over thee, all the Attributes of God are engaged againſt thee. The inflexible Juſtice, and Wiſdom, and Holineſs, his infinite Power, and never failing Truth and Veracity, will all combine to make thee everlaſtingly miſerable. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do righteouſly? <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. Will Infinite Power let ſuch Contempt of his Grace (which hath ſtooped ſo low) go unreven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? Will he ſuffer the proud Sinner to Spit in the Face of his Son (for unbelief and rejecting him is no better) and not wipe off that aſperſion, by the eternal ruin and perdition of the ſinner? Will it conſiſt with the perfect Wiſdom of God, to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:134641:184"/>look down upon the unbeliever, and ſee him trample ſuch amazing Love and Mercy under his feet, not once nor twice, but ſo many Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as make up the Number of his Life, and not recompence ſuch baſe Ingratitude and wicked Preſumption, according to its deſert?

Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that tho he was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. When we were fallen into the deepeſt reproach and ſhame; he made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, that he might advance us to the higheſt dignity and honour, 2 <hi>Phill.</hi> 6.7. He humbled himſelf to the death, that he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our life, he made a low ſtoop, that he might lift us up when ſin had caſt us down; He took upon him the humane Nature, that he might make us partakers of the Divine Nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. compared with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Foraſmuch as the Children are partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part with them, that through Death he might deſtroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for us exceeding rich and precious Promiſes, that by them we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature; It was no ſmall Endearment of himſelf to us to paſs by the Angels and put forth his hand to help us: For verily he took not upon him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> 2 <hi>Heb.</hi> 16.

The ſame rational Appetite that prompts us to love Goodneſs, doth alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to love the greateſt Good, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heat and fervour of Affection: But eſpecially when the difference is ſo vaſt as it is between God and all competitory Good whatſoever: They are but like a Drop to the whole Ocean, or a ſmall Duſt compared to the whole Globe of Earth: A ſingle Beam of Light may as well ſtand up and vye Glory, as with the Sun: And a little Sword of Graſs, may better compare with the Spirit of Life and Vegetation, and all the Flowers of the Field: as any Created Good may hold up its
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:134641:192"/>head againſt God: Shall I ſay? As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, or as far as the Heaven is above the Earth, ſo great is the diſtance between God and all Creatures put together! Or rather, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is a thouſand times greater, even infinite and incomprehenſible, and far beyond any created Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to conceive.</p>
               <p>His Excellency is moſt apparent above all other Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that all the kinds and degrees of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Perfection are united in him, which are but ſcattered and divided amongſt the Creatures, and that which they have but ſome faint degree of dwelleth in him, in the higheſt meaſure of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and exuperancy: So that if there be any Beauty or Glory in the Frame of Heaven and Earth, or any Creatures in them contained, that can ſtir up deſire, and attract our Love, the ſame Motive with infinite Advantage may be fetch'd from the moſt lovely Nature of God; And though the things with which Mortal Men are commonly moved, are not formally in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they imply imperfection: ſuch as are Worldly Riches, Corporeal Beauty, Senſual Pleaſures, and all thoſe Accommodations which ſuit that part of us which is Fleſh and Blood, yet they are in him theſe ſeveral ways, 1. <hi>Per viam Eminentiae,</hi> by way of Excellency, as the rational Soul doth eminently contain the ſenſitive, though not formally: And as the underſtanding of Man, that invents Watches and Clocks, and other Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, is far better than they, and doth eminently contain them. 2. <hi>Per viam Cauſalitatis,</hi> by way of Efficiency, in that he is able to produce and create
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:134641:192"/>any of theſe things with the leaſt Word of his Mouth: He is therefore eminently able to furniſh out all good to the Soul that loveth him: And ſo he hath promiſed, To give them the deſires of their Heart, that delight in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. And therefore the Apoſtle had ground enough to tell us, That Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, (in this life to underſtand) the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.

But then it is becauſe the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Soul are all out of courſe, and Senſe hath got the upper hand, and Reaſon is under Feet, and his Head ſtands where his Feet ſhould do: Alas!

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It doth moſt highly beſeem a Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature <hi>to love God above all,</hi> becauſe <hi>God hath most obliged us:</hi> His Love to us, bids higheſt, for the higheſt Return of Love again. If there were any thing in Heaven or Earth that had more obliged us than God, it had not been than a Fault, neither could Reaſon have riſen up and accuſed us, if we had loved that thing more than God: But now that all Creatures both in Heaven and Earth are ſilent, and have nothing to ſay, and the love of God hath ſo loud a Tongue, and his infinite tranſcendent Favours do beſpeak our Hearts ſo ſtrongly, what an unpardonable ſin is it to love any thing more than him? The Good we receive from others, is by his Special Command and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what we receive therefore from them, we are indebted unto God for: He is the firſt Mover; they are but his Inſtruments, to bring his Favours to us: Now though his Perſonal Excellency and Perfection, may juſtly challenge our greateſt Love and Eſteem, yet the unparallel Good he hath done us, doth call for much more. <hi>Nimii durus eſt Animas</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) qui &amp; ſi Amorem non velit impendere, nolit rependere:</hi> It's a baſe Nature indeed and highly unreaſonable, that will not pay Love with Love. Can we be content to receive all from God, and to repay nothing back again? He that gives him not the prime and choice of his Affections, gives him nothing in the Scripture Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yea, he is reputed a Hater of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. If any Man come to me, and hate not, (that is, love them not leſs) his Father and Mother,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:134641:194"/>and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple: Let but ſome of thoſe Numberleſs Favours which thou haſt received from him, be but a while conſidered, and it will utterly ſhame and put to ſilence this odious ſin: And the unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hard-hearted ſinner that is not melted by ſuch love as this, muſt needs be confounded in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts thereof, either here or hereafter. Here in Repentance, or hereafter in Torment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou haſt thy very Being from him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which thou wert uncapable of any Love or Kindneſs from God or any Creature: He gave thee that very Heart which thou denieſt him, and whereby thou ſlighteſt him; He gave thee thy Memory to remember him, Thy Mind to think upon him: He gave thee that Faculty of Love, that it might burn continually towards him: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Soul, to ſet any thing above him in thy Love and Eſteem! That hadſt been a Brute and no Man, if it had pleaſed him! and might'ſt then have wanted ſuch a gift to beſtow on him, or any other thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame Hand that gave thee thy Being at the firſt, doth yet continue it, and preſerve thee every Day and Night, every Hour and Moment: If he ſhould but ſubtract his Hand, thou would'ſt ſoon dye and return to thy Duſt again: Thou haſt forfeited Life, and deſerved Death over and over. How oft haſt thou run upon deſtruction, and he hath ſaved thee, and reverſed the Sentence of Death, when the Law hath condemned thee? And lengthned out this Life to thee, that thou might'ſt repent, and live for ever? And doſt
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:134641:194"/>thou live by his meer grace and favour every day, and yet loveſt him not above all other things? This is highly abſurd and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thy Life and all other Comforts, are not only the Fruit of his Bounty, but of his meer Grace and Mercy: They have been all forfeited a thouſand times over: Every Sin calls for Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Execution upon the ſinner, and condemns him to univerſal want and miſery: But the Blood of God hath purchaſed them back again to thee, and the hand of God hath reſtored them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſo baſe a Wretch into a ſtate of favour, and condition of hope: And under each of theſe comprehenſive Mercies, infinite particulars might be reckoned up: And now what canſt thou ſet up in Competition with Him? Thy Wit? Thine Underſtanding? Thy Health? Strength? Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Friends? Riches? Honour? Life? Or any Proviſion that's made for it? Theſe all belong to him, They are his Talents: Art thou a Debter to all, or any one of theſe, that thou ſhouldſt ſerve, love, or eſteem them, more than him who is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably thy Benefactor?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God deſerveth our greateſt love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is to us, <hi>The moſt ſuitable Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that's the moſt ſuitable good, that doth moſt fitly and fully ſupply all our Neceſſities and ſatisfie our moſt rational Deſires; Now who, or what can pretend to compare with him in this reſpect, or ſtand in a competition with him?</p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:134641:195"/>
               <p>There are <hi>Two great Neceſſities</hi> which every Soul lies under, 1. The one is in reſpect of Sin: The 2d. in reſpect of Suffering and Miſery, which Two comprize all the Wants and Neceſſities of Man: Both which none is capable of removing, but Chriſt our Redeemer, who is God-Man, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for evermore.</p>
               <p>And for the firſt <hi>Sin,</hi> It expoſeth every ſinner to two great Wants: The One of <hi>Pardon;</hi> The Other of <hi>Sanctification:</hi> In the want of either of which, it's plainly impoſſible, that any Man ſhould be happy.</p>
               <p>And this needs no other Proof, that the bare Explication of what <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pardon</hi> is but the Removal of Guilt, which every Sinner doth contract. Now Guilt being an Obligation unto Puniſhment, Pardon muſt needs be the diſſolving or nulling of that Obligation; which if it ſhould continue, and not be removed, the guilty ſinner muſt needs be terrified and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the ſenſe of his obnoxiouſneſs to God's diſpleaſure, who perfectly hates Sin, and loves Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, more than all his Creatures, and therefore muſt needs reſent any Affront done to them, as it were to the Apple of his Eye, where ſuch Guilt lies upon any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which ſenſe cannot but ariſe in every Sinner, when Conſcience is awake, [which will be ſooner or later;] And then he that knows God is his Enemy cannot ſure be happy, ſince he hath infinite power and wiſdom againſt him: And this is the very Caſe of every one that lies under Guilt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, he hath Almighty God for his Enemy.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:134641:195"/>
               <p>And as the want of Pardon cannot conſiſt with Happineſs, ſo neither can the want of</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sanctification.</hi> For as <hi>he that hath God for his Enemy</hi> cannot be happy, ſo neither can <hi>he that is an Enemy unto God:</hi> And ſuch a one is every unſanctified and unrenewed Soul, who being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to God, cannot take pleaſure in him, nor have any complacency in thoſe things which are ſuited to his bleſſed Nature: But loves them juſt as the Bird doth the Snare, from whence he will fly and eſcape, with all the ſpeed he can: But he that cannot <hi>love God above all,</hi> and delight chiefly in his Ways, can never be happy: becauſe theſe are the only Ways that can perfect his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and make him happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> being thus explained, it evidently follows by clear conſequence, that without theſe two, the ſinner cannot be happy, but ſuch a one is every Man, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe <hi>two Supplies,</hi> no Soul can be happy: Thus much being evident and demonſtrable, it is as plain that none can remove the <hi>Guilt and Filth</hi> that ſin implies, but God who alone can remit ſin, and ſanctifie the ſinner and diſpoſe him by Holineſs to the Love of God and all Righteouſneſs, wherein his chief happineſs doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Second grand Neceſſity</hi> which Man lies under [which indeed comprehends all Neceſſities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever] is <hi>Miſery</hi> or Suffering, which comprizeth all that Evil in <hi>Effect,</hi> which ſin doth in the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> All that Sickneſs and Sorrow, and Trouble and Fear, and Diſcontent and Death, and thoſe ſad Expectations after it, are the Fruit and Effect of Sin, by Reſultancy oftentimes, and always by
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:134641:196"/>way of a Righteous Puniſhment and Compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yea, Sin is ſuch a Monſter, that it not only deſerves, but alſo inflicts Evil upon the Manſion where it dwells, and like that <hi>cruel Emperour,</hi> rips up the Womb that bare it, and is both the <hi>Malefactor and Executioner,</hi> yea, and the very <hi>Death</hi> alſo that is inflicted. I mean, (that I may avoid Metaphors, and ſpeak properly,) That Sin is both the meritorious, efficient, I, and formal Cauſe of a great part of our Sufferings and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; though not in its formal, yet in its mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Conſideration. And as a Beaſt that being confined within its right Paſture, by ſome Pale, or Fence, doth by the ſame violence, break the Fence and hurt it ſelf, and get into more Feeding: ſo doth every ſinner, by the ſame Tranſgreſſion, violate God's Law and his own Welfare, and is both <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> in the ſame inordinate Action: For it's one great End of God's Law, to tye Mens hands, that they ſhould not hurt themſelves: So that <hi>God's Honour</hi> and <hi>Man's Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> do enter the very definition of all his Laws; ſo great is the Wiſdom of our Supreme Law-giver: But the foregoing Similitude is but lame and doth not fully expreſs the formal Effect of Sin, (as I may call it.) Tradition to Sin, is threatned as the moſt fearful Judgment in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now God alone that can remove the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> can alſo free the Sinner from the ſad and woful Conſequents, and then Happineſs will be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult: For he that is freed from all Evil whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and yet hath an immortal duration, muſt needs be happy. For without the bleſſed Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, ſuch a reaſonable Soul as Man hath,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:134641:196"/>that can ſee backwards, and forwards, and hath the Paſſions of Hope, Fear, Love, Joy, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be at reſt, and ceaſe from ſelf-tormenting Thoughts and Actions.</p>
               <p>Since therefore it's God only that can ſupply all the Neceſſities of a rational Creature, it follows, that he only is the moſt ſuitable and proper good to ſuch a Creature, and therefore <hi>is principally, and as far as is poſſible to be deſired and loved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Third Reaſon why it is ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and doth ſo well beſeem a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to love God above all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is moſt highly Congruous and Reaſonable, ſo it is the Higheſt Dignity and Honour that a Rational Creature is capable of.</p>
               <p>If Honour be truly to be eſtimated, either by the <hi>Nobleneſs of the Act,</hi> for which any one is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, or the <hi>Perſons</hi> in whoſe Eſteem we are advanced; both theſe ways be united to God above all things in Love, is the higheſt honour that a Creature can ever arrive to, unleſs it be to exchange ſincerity of Love, for Perfection, or to add further degrees to this Love, till it comes to its <hi>ultimum quod ſic,</hi> or vertical Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There's no Act</hi> that can put a greater Luſtre upon the Agent, than that which is directly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon God, eſpecially in the way of Love. For the Object as it gives <hi>Specification,</hi> ſo it gives <hi>Worth and Nobleneſs</hi> to the Act, and that reflects it upon the Faculty firſt, and then upon the Agent, whoſe Faculty it is: For as the Act is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:134641:197"/>that's exerciſed about a Kingdom, than that which is exerciſed upon lower and baſer things; ſo that Faculty is more noble, that's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing ſuch an Act, than that which is capable only of doing the other Acts: And by conſequence, he that ſteereth or governeth a Ship, is more honourable, than he that rows it: Or rather, a Prince is more honourable than a Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, becauſe his Acts are converſant about a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler object.</p>
               <p>This being paſt diſpute, it follows, that the Servant of God is far more highly dignified, than any other Servant whatſoever: Now Love being the principal Part of his Service, becauſe it is the Service of the Heart, which he chiefly requires; It's therefore the higheſt Honour to Love him with the whole Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And God eſteems that Perſon moſt highly, that thus loves him: becauſe All the Promiſes of the Goſpel are made to ſuch, which are the higheſt Expreſſions of God's Bounty and Love; And thoſe whom he doth moſt richly endow and favour, them he doth moſt highly honour: Particularly, 1. God dwelleth in them here. 2. And they ſhall dwell with God hereafter. Now what greater Honour can there be, than Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Co-habitation with the <hi>Fountain of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to love God ſuperlatively and above all, is 1. Moſt Reaſonable: 2. Moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. So,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It brings in the greateſt Profit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For hereby,</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:134641:197"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If this Love prevail over all other Love, it aſcertains to us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Relative Grace</hi> which conſiſts in Pardon of all Sin; Juſtification of our Perſons; Peace and Favour with God or Friendſhip with him; and Sonſhip to him; and Right to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And alſo to all <hi>Real Grace,</hi> whereby every Chriſtian is ſhaped and faſhioned to the Divine Nature and Similitude: And therefore may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently expect, that in the uſe of Means the Holy Spirit ſhould enable him to thrive and bring forth the Fruit of a ſounder Knowledge in Spiritual Things, of Patience, Humility, Meekneſs, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, Temperance, Brotherly Love, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, every one of which is a Jewel of ineſtimable worth: In a word, He hath a ſound Title, by the Free Charter of the Goſpel, to all that Chriſt hath purchaſed and procured by the Merit of his Blood.</p>
               <p>And as his Love encreaſeth in the Degree and Meaſure, and groweth towards Perfection, ſo it doth encreaſe the Meaſure of every Grace; And then Aſſurance, which is the Conſequent of an higher Meaſure of Grace than ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians aſpire to, uſually flows in: And then ſuch a Meaſure of Boldneſs and Confidence in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God, as doth uſually fill the Heart with daily Comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as this prevailing Love doth gather ſtrength, ſo Peace at Home, and inward Calmneſs and Tranquility doth encreaſe: And this is a continual Feaſt, ſweeter than all the troubleſome, diſturbing Pleaſures of the World: The more any Soul is conſcious to it ſelf of a
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:134641:198"/>prevailing Love to God, and that he hath the Supremacy in his Heart, the more all his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do unite and conſpire to Quietneſs, Reſt, and Peace: For there's nothing that puts a Man into Tumult and Diſorder, but the greedy deſire after ſomething that looks like Happineſs, but when it's gotten, proves no ſuch thing, and vexeth the Soul with Fruſtration and continual Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now the more the Soul is in love with God, the more it is acquainted with the true happineſs, and is the leſs in danger to be diverted by falſe and lying Promiſes: And when once the Soul hath got this Harbour, it will ſtir no more out ſo as to forſake it, but ſilently feeds on conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual pleaſure, and dwells at eaſe, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.13. And knows that all farther labour is vain, unleſs it be to grow more deeply rooted in love: And this Peace and inward Joy, is always the Companion of Aſſurance, in ſome ſenſible degree; however it may perchance be wanting to thoſe, and altogether imperceptible, that have the weakeſt and loweſt meaſure of true, or prevailing love to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And as this Love encreaſeth all trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſlaviſh Fear, and ſad Expectations do ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fly away: Who that hath the intereſt in God, that ſuch a love doth entitle to, need to fear Sickneſs, or Poverty, or Croſſes, or Death it ſelf conſiderably, if he knows he is united to one ſo firmly that hath Life and Death in his hands, and hath the Command of all Creatures in Heaven, and Earth and Hell? The Sleep of ſuch a Man muſt needs be ſweet; His Food, though never ſo courſe, cannot but refreſh and comfort him;
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:134641:198"/>And all his Comforts, are Comforts indeed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of them are diſturbed with thoſe, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Mad, and diſturbing Paſſions, that every Man void of this love of God cannot be free from more or leſs: How quietly doth ſuch a Man lie down and riſe up, becauſe the Lord, when he thus loves, maketh him to dwell continually in ſafety? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As this Love encreaſeth, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will loſe its force, and grow weaker and weaker: How little will Riches and Honour and worldly Pleaſures draw that Man to commit ſin, and diſpleaſe God, that feels the love of God and the ſweet Conſequences of it in his Soul? and alſo knows, that he hath or may have enough in him: They may tempt a Fool and one that hath little or no experience of the love of God, and that wants ſomething to ſet his heart at reſt and quiet: But he that is rich already, and truly happy, will not eaſily catch at ſhadows, but ſtudy to keep what he is poſſeſſed of, and which he knows to be Treaſure indeed: He may in a ſhort fit of inconſideracy, perhaps, forget God and his Soul, and give ſome eaſe to Temptation in ſuch an hour, but he will quickly return again: And then when he remembers God again, he will be troubled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3. And his folly will coſt him dear; And his Soul will cleave the faſter after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to God, when he hath been better taught by ſo bad experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As this love encreaſeth, all baſe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did love will ſlink away and depart with confuſion and ſhame: Who will love a Harlot that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when he may honeſtly enjoy ſweeter and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:134641:199"/>better love? Sure none but a perverted, diſtempered Mind. Who will feed upon Husks, when he may have the moſt pleaſant, wholſome and delicious Fare? None but one that hath loſt his Reaſon: And who will dote upon a Trifle, when he may have a Crown and Kingdom to be delighted with? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo far as a Man feels he loves God, he diſdains the love of other things, that will not conſiſt with him: And he will abhor the Motion that's back'd with the greateſt worldly Preferment, that would draw away his heart from God: Had he not taſted how good and gracious the Lord is, and how happy a thing it is to live in Unity with him; He might perchance hearken to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding Pleaſure that courts his Affections: But after he hath received the love of God into his heart, and felt what a reviving Cordial it is, the Pleaſures and Honours of the World come too late, and ſeem but Dung and Droſs when they are laid in the Scales with that. <hi>No Man,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>having drunk old Wine, ſtraightway deſireth new: for he ſaith, The old is better, Luke</hi> 5.39. You know that famous Marqueſs (<hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leoc. Carac.</hi>) was moved with indignation at ſuch an offer as that: <hi>Curſed are they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that think all the Gold and Silver in the World, worth one day's Communion with Chriſt.</hi> And thrice wicked are they, that would wed Mens Affections to the World and divorce them from Chriſt: When there is a plain Competition or Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between God and any worldly happineſs, the preſentment of ſuch a happineſs to a gracious heart, and one that truly loves God, looks like a motion from the Devil, and provokes him to fly
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:134641:199"/>in the face of him that makes it, and to abhor ſuch a Sollicitor. Let me live, ſaith ſuch a one, in Poverty and Raggs, rather than forgo what I now enjoy: Let thoſe that never felt the love of God in their hearts, feed upon Traſh, (if they pleaſe) I have a better Dyet. <hi>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord (and his favour) than the greateſt treaſure without it,</hi> Prov. 15.16. <hi>Better is a dinner of Herbs, where this love is, than a ſtalled Ox, and hatred therewith,</hi> verſ. 17. It's but a ridiculous, fooliſh thought, to think to draw an experienced Saint away from the love of God, by Silver and Gold, and a little gaudy Apparel, and delicious Fare, and two or three fair Words, and ſome few more ſlight Courteſies the World can do for him, when he ſees the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an immovable Rock, and a Reed ſhaken with every wind; <hi>And that there is none in Heaven but God, and none upon the Earth that his ſoul can deſire in compariſon of him,</hi> Pſ. 73.25. <hi>The Law of thy Mouth</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>is dearer to me than thouſands of Gold and Silver: more to be deſired than Gold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.14.</note> 
                  <hi>yea than the moſt ſolid refined Gold; ſweeter alſo than the Honey, and the dropping of the Honey-comb, Pſalm</hi> 19.10. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Law was ſo lovely and excellent in his eſteem, much more the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that the Love of God is the beſt Antidote againſt all baſe and poiſonous love whatſoever, and will not permit the World with any of its Pleaſures to prevail where it is: It will caſt this Bond-woman with her Sons, and not ſuffer them to be Co-heirs with God and his Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:134641:200"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since therefore</hi> (O my Soul!) it is ſo highly conſonant to that Reaſon that is in thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth ſo much to the higheſt Honour and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and brings in ſuch incomparable Advantage, Why art thou ſo backward and averſe to this ſweeteſt Imployment? which is ſo <hi>ſweet,</hi> 1. In the very Exerciſe. 2. And <hi>ſweeter</hi> the more it is exerciſed. 3. And makes all other Duty, <hi>ſweet, eaſie,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant;</hi> which for want of this <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> goes on but dully ſometimes, and is quickly tyred: And ſo much as this warm Affection is wanting, all thy Services will wax more and more chill and cold, till at laſt, if that ſpark go quite out, (I mean as to the exerciſe) there will be a ſtop in all Duty, and all will be frozen up. And if the Pulſe of this Affection ceaſe to beat towards God, all Devotion and Exerciſe of Piety towards him, will ſuffer a <hi>Deliquium,</hi> and be in a fainting Fit and Swone.</p>
               <p>Why then is thy heart no more tranſported with this Love? <hi>David</hi> felt ſo much pleaſure and ſweetneſs in this Work, that he could not forbear to provoke others to partake with him, in <hi>this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt delight,</hi> by a moſt Patherical Invitation, <hi>O Love the Lord, all ye his Saints, for the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the Faithful,</hi> Pſalm 31.23. Thou canſt love other things too ſenſibly, that have not half the force and ſtrength that <hi>this Object</hi> hath to draw and invite this Affection; And have moreover, diſappointed thee too often of the Pleaſure and Felicity that from them thou haſt expected: yea, and which is far worſe, have entangled thee in many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards betrayed thee to ſad and bitter complaints.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:134641:200"/>But here's an Object worthy thy ſtrongeſt love, that will not debaſe and deſtroy, but advance thy Soul to the higheſt Perfection: The Love of him, as it is <hi>ſweet in the exerciſe,</hi> ſo it will end at laſt in <hi>unſpeakable ſweetneſs;</hi> and will not upbraid thee with Folly afterwards, as all other Love will be ſure to do: Thou mayeſt love other things too much, and here's the Source and Spring of all Sin and Impiety, and of all abſurd and unreaſonable Practices: For as <hi>Divine Love</hi> is the ſum of Duty, and all worthy and becoming Actions; ſo <hi>Carnal Love,</hi> or the Love of Creatures, is the Sum of all Wickedneſs, and all incongruous and unſeemly Practice: But God can never be exalted too high in thine <hi>Eſtimation and Affections:</hi> Here thou mayeſt ſafely vent and pour out all the ſtore of thy Love with the greateſt delight and ſecurity; and expatiate thy Soul to the wideſt extent in the Ocean of his infinite and moſt lovely Perfections: To him thou mayeſt ſafely offer up thy Soul in ſacrifice, as a <hi>whole-Burnt-Offering</hi> in the Fire of Love for ever; Wilt thou permit thy Thoughts any more to fly abroad into Trifles and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Matters, when thou haſt the immenſe Ocean of Divine Goodneſs to lanch forth into, and mayeſt loſe thy ſelf, with the greateſt pleaſure and advantage, in the depths of his infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: Here to be even drowned and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, is not Death, but the ſweeteſt and moſt raviſhing Life: Haſt thou not pined long enough, and melted away in the Cares and Love of the World, the Martyrdom which corrupt Nature prompts thee faſt enough to chuſe? Is it not now more than Time to be wiſer, and to bare
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:134641:201"/>an Honourable Teſtimony to him that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee? And to ſubſcribe that Witneſs to the Truth, which thou haſt borne too much hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to Lies and Falſehood? Let them be taken by thee for Fools and Madmen, that torture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Love and Care of this World, and take Hell by that violence, that the Kingdom of Heaven ſhould be taken by: But let the main ſtream and current of thine Affections be ever after him, in whom are all the dimenſions of Perfection: Some little Twilight and Glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Raviſhing Beauty thou haſt ſeen in his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Works;</hi> But oh how ſhort! how exceeding ſhort have they been, through thy wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Blindneſs and Inadvertency! But theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs not the thouſandth part of his wonderful, aſtoniſhing Splendour and Glory: Something it may be thou haſt taſted of; his ſweeteſt, reviving Love: But oh how little, in reſpect of what thou might'ſt have had, had it not been for thy own wilful neglect and refuſal! Hadſt thou gazed as much upon his Glory, as thou haſt done upon the fading, tranſitory Glory of the World, and ſtudied his Perfections, according to the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and Advantages he hath given thee, and not loved diſmal, affrighting Darkneſs, rather than the quickning, trransforming Light, and neglected the beſt uſe of thine Underſtanding and Affections in holy Meditations on God; Thou might'ſt confidently have expected the Bleſſing of God in a Work ſo well pleaſing to him, and found the Treaſure that would have made thee contemn all other things in Compariſon: Then thou might'ſt have had joy in the darkeſt Night
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:134641:201"/>of Affliction, and ſuch an Allay to the bittereſt Cup, that would have made any Condition wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to thee: Then thou would'ſt have forgotten all the Miſeries of thy life paſt, and remembred them as Waters that paſs away, <hi>Job</hi> 11.16. Then thou might'ſt have lyen down with the ſenſe of the pardon of former ſins, yea, thou might'ſt have lyen down, and thy ſleep would have been ſweet to thee. Then the Remembrance of thy latter End would not have been ſuch an unpleaſant Theme to thy Meditations, as now it is: yea, the Lord would have ſatisfied thy Soul in Drought, and made thee like a watered Garden, and like a Spring whoſe Waters fail not, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58.11. And then with what vivacity and chearfulneſs ſhould'ſt thou have performed all Duty, and borne all Sufferings, when God had once anſwered thee in the joy of thy Heart!</p>

               <p n="1">1. They may change their Nature; Land may change its Fertility, and become barren and good for nothing, while the Owner ſtands by and looks on; or elſe if his Fruit grow up and raiſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, there's a thouſand Accidents may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept it, before it come into his Store-houſe, and be laid up for his immediate uſe; it may be ſuddenly ſmitten with a blaſt from Heaven; it may be parched with exceſſive heats, or nipp'd with cold, and drowned with intemperate ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Or if it ſcapes all theſe, the Lord may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Armies, the Locuſts and Caterpillers, or ſome Vermin to devour it: There are Ways

               <p>Or if all this will not load the fickle things of this World with diſgrace enough, and they may ſcape all the forementioned Caſualties, yet,</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Owner may be taken from them?</hi> Who can ſay that his Pulſe ſhall certainly beat an hour longer? Such a vapour is the Life of Man, that there ſcarce can be any more uncertain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure: When his Mountain ſtands ſtrongeſt, yet he is in the hands of him that ſet faſt the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who is girded with power enough to overturn them with one Word or Beck: <hi>My Times are in thy hands,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 31.15.</p>

               <p>Yea, to ſuperadd one more Diſparagement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whilſt the Enjoyment and Enjoyer both continue together, a Man may want an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and ſo relliſh nothing that he hath, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.1, 2 There is an Evil: And then no wonder if he ſtarve in the midſt of Plenty; and pine away from day to day, whilſt he hath the moſt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtorative Food that Earth can ſet before him: It will then be no marvel, if Leanneſs enter into his Soul, though God hath given him all that his Fleſh can deſire, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15.) If the Rich Man's Pallate be but a little feaveriſh, through the Diſtempers of his Body or Mind, his great Revenues, his ſtately Houſe, his beautiful Wife, his numerous Off-ſpring, all his Flatterers, and the reſt of his Accommodations, ſignifie nothing to him: yea, a little Pet or Diſcontent, will turn all into Gall and Bitterneſs, and make him moſt angry with thoſe that ſtudy to pleaſe him moſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To ſhew yet further how worthy they are to be contemned, Conſider, They are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with much difficulty; Kept with much care and trouble; Loſt with much ſorrow: 1. It's not one of many that gets the Riches of this World; ſome indeed are born to them, but how many are defeated of their hopes, before they grow up: And what doth their Birth-right ſerve for, but to make them the more miſerable? This is all the Priviledge they have, by being born of Rich and Noble Parents, that perchance fall into Poverty or Diſgrace, before their Children are ripe: And for the reſt, how many Difficulties do they paſs, before they get them into their Poſſeſſion? It
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:134641:205"/>may be Twenty or Thirty Years they are ſubject to the Will and Humour of thoſe that give them: And when they have done all, it may be, they are diſinherited, and put to hard ſhifts. But of thoſe that are not born to them, they are more hardly gotten; It coſts them many a weary day, and many a reſtleſs, watchful Night, much Sweat and Pain, to get a poor, little Portion! And yet the greateſt part of the Price by which they are uſually purchaſed, is yet behind; Whilſt they are venturing after Riches, they too frequently loſe God and their Souls, if not by a plain and open, yet by a ſecret and virtual renouncing of them: though not by groſs and manifeſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet by a ſinful and dangerous neglect of God and their Souls: And yet of thoſe that thus labour for them, the greateſt part do not ſucceed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet after they are once gotten; Are they not too often wrecked with Cares and Thoughts how to preſerve and keep them? They are fain to bear the Blows of them that are above them;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12.</note> And the Envy and Diſcontents of thoſe that are under them, and the Cheats and Circumvention of thoſe that have more Wit. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which is the moſt ponderous Aggravation of their Vanity, As Men are ſick for them, ſo are they ſick of them, and yet they count it death to part with them: Firſt they are ſick of deſire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they get them, and then they are by and by ſick of Fruition; But it cuts them to the heart, to have the morbifick matter removed: And yet whether they conſent or not, when all is
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:134641:206"/>done, and the utmoſt diligence is uſed to defend them, they muſt part at laſt, and the owner muſt leave them, or they will leave the owner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> They are the great Snares and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Mens Souls: What is it that draws any Man to ſin againſt God, and deſtroy his own Soul, but the ſweet Bit of worldly Pleaſure or Profit? No Man would ſwear or lye, or deal deceitfully, or live idly, or drink and whore, but for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and advantage that he expects in ſo doing. Who would covet and care for the World, and labour ſo painfully to get it into his Poſſeſſion, if he did not dream of Happineſs from it? And yet it is but a Dream; And every Promiſe that the World makes of true Content and Felicity, is but a Lye: And he that's over credulous in ſuch a Caſe as this, is worſe than mad: True it is, the World hath ſomething in it that's fitted to the pleaſure and delight of Fleſh and Blood, in an ordinary Courſe of Providence: And we being ſo prone to pleaſe, yea, and over-pleaſe <hi>this Part,</hi> we are in great and contirual danger from the World? And wilt thou ſo much eſteem and ſeek after that, that will deſtroy thee, if thou learn not to ſlight and contemn it? Haſt thou ſped ſo well already, (O my Soul!) that thou ſhould'ſt be ſtill tampering with it? Haſt thou ſo well quit thy ſelf already, and eſcaped the Thruſts it hath made at thee? Hath it made no breach in the Conſcience? No Wounds in thy Heart? Hath it begot no strangeneſs nor Jealouſie between God and thy Soul? Hath it not ſadly wounded thee in thine Intellectuals, and much perverted thine Underſtanding? Hath it done no Miſchief to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:134641:206"/>thy Will and Affections, but helped them Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venwards to the only Place of their Reſt? I would it had thus dealt with thee; But ſuch a Friend it never was, nor will be whilſt it's loved for its ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The World is God's great (if not only Competitor) and therefore in ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be contemned: Though the Devil and the Fleſh, fight againſt God both of them, and uſe the World as their chief Weapon, yet by way of object to Man's Soul, there's nothing but God and the World, openly pretend to be Man's Happineſs: The Devil doth but ſet this Bait be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, when he tempts us unto ſin; He dare not appear himſelf, to draw any by his own proper and innate beauty, who is almoſt known of all, to be ſo monſtrous and deformed; and whom every one [that is not himſelf become a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter] hath a natural inſtinct to hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor.</p>
               <p>Indeed there be ſome few ſuch that he hath gotten ſo wholly into his power, [through the juſt and fearful permiſſion of God; for their wicked Rejection and Contempt of him] that they take him for their Ruler and Guide to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, for want of a better, and ſwear Fealty to him; But I believe it is with ſome ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy and Regret: But however, I here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand World in ſo large a ſenſe, as to involve all Creatures in its Latitude: And what, doth it not ſeem a ridiculous thing and odious Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the World or Devil to ſtand againſt God, and compare their Worth and Excellency with his? Let them ſhew their own, if they will
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:134641:207"/>vye with him: Or let them bring ſomething that's laſting and ſatisfactory? Let them ſhew ſomething that will anſwer all the hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Man? Something that will help him in every ſtreight and neceſſity: Nay, that will free him from all ſuch ſtreights and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if they would have the honour of rational love and eſteem: What ſhall Dung and Droſs lye in the Scales, with an Eternal weight of Glory? Shall it put any one, but a Fool, to debate which he ſhall chuſe, when there is ſuch an unſpeakable difference? Art thou ſo void of Underſtanding, and ſo much forſaken of common Reaſon, that any thing ſhall ſeem deſirable to thee, that's laid in the Ballance with the Fountain of all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? O let thine Heart abhor its former Guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this kind, and henceforth boyl up with Hatred and Contempt againſt ſuch an Uſurper that would be preferred before God; Reſolve, and that fixedly, never to hearken to ſuch an impious and abſurd Motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The Love of the World is but meer Flattery and Deceit: It is not to be truſted when it makes the moſt fair and faithful Promiſes, and gives the ſtrongeſt ſecurity to Performance: <hi>Job, Haman, Manaſſeh, Zedekiah,</hi> and <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> are proof enough of this, to go no further than the Bible: <hi>Look not on the Vine,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the Cup, when it moveth it ſelf aright, At the laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder,</hi> Prov. 23.31, 32. When the World ſmiles moſt, and looks the moſt pleaſingly, it uſually gives the moſt mortal ſtab: Let the Experience of all Ages ſpeak out, and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:134641:207"/>tell us plainly, how the World hath uſed its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Followers and Admirers: ſome it hath taken from the Top of all their worldly Dignity and Glory, and made the very Scorn and Contempt of all. Thus it ſerved the famous <hi>Belliſarius,</hi> that great and worthy Commander under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Juſtinian:</hi> Thus alſo it ſerved <hi>Seianus,</hi> the great Favorite of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Pillippa</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanian,</hi> that was ſo famous in the Court of <hi>Naples:</hi> Thus it uſed the great <hi>Darius, Cyrus, Craeſus,</hi> and the proud <hi>Bajazet,</hi> with infinite others, that were gotten to the height of worldly Proſperity: But thoſe that it hath uſed beſt, it hath left them at laſt to grapple with Death and Judgment. It ſaves none from the devouring ſtroke of Death: It accompanies none beyond the Grave; Thither if it chance to bring any of its Paramours, there to be ſure it leaves them: Their Glory ſhall not depart after them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49.17. The Happineſs and Felicity of the World will be ſure to leave us in our greateſt need: Theſe Goards will be ſure to wither before the Morning of the Reſurrection, when we ſhall need moſt Protection from the ſcorching heat of God's wrath: But if we go to the Sanctuary, there we may more certainly learn, how it hath, and will befriend thoſe that have doted moſt upon it, and have ventured the Favour of God, and their Everlaſting Hopes, for the World: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92.7. <hi>When the wicked ſpring as the graſs, and all the workers of iniquity do flouriſh, it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever.</hi> And how doth the World then ſtand up in their behalf, when they are betrayed thereby to ſuch a fearful Deſtruction? It leaves them to the ſtroke
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:134641:208"/>of Juſtice, to ſhift for themſelves: <hi>Job</hi> 20.5, 6, 7. <hi>The triumphing of the wicked is ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment; Though his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds, yet he ſhall periſh for ever, as his own dung: All they which have ſeen him, ſhall ſay, Where is he? This is the Portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God,</hi> Job 20.29. Thus the World gives up its Lovers to the Wrath of God, and ſhall come in as a Witneſs alſo to their Everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The prevailing Love of any thing here on Earth, is a Sin not fit to be pardoned, if a Man dye in it: And it is an infallible Mark of one, that ſhall periſh without Mercy, yea, and of one whom God hateth: 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world. If any man love the world,</hi> (in this predominant meaſure) <hi>the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And <hi>James</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ye adulterers and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world, is emnity with God? He therefore that will be a friend of the world, is an enemy unto God.</hi> Luke 14.26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not</hi> [that is, love them not leſs] <hi>his Father, and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, and his own Life, much more all other things, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Theſe are the plain Paſſages of God's Word, that ſhew manifeſtly, how every one ſhall be ſure to ſpeed, that loveth any thing here below, more than Chriſt: No Apology can be made for ſuch a one, neither is ſuch a one a Subject capable of Mercy, if he live and dye in that ſtate, that ſets ſo light
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:134641:208"/>by it, and God the Author of it, as to prefer ſuch a ſhort liv'd Trifle before him: That ſay unto God Directly, or by Conſequence, by Word, or Practice, ſtand thou here at my Foot-ſtool, when the World is exalted and ſet up in Honour and Eſteem: In a word, to love any Thing more than God, is a Sin that the Goſpel hath no pardon for, if it be final, becauſe it argues an ungodly Heart, and he that's ungodly, cannot be a Believer or a Chriſtian: Becauſe the Means, preſuppoſe the End, and Chriſtianity, which is the way to God, preſuppoſeth Godlineſs, or ſome Love to God, [who is the End intended or deſired,] And without Faith the Goſpel Grant giveth no Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Till a Man can contemn the World, (in the ſenſe before ſtated) he is no better than a Brute: ſo far is he from the Life and Spirit of a Chriſtian: Chriſtianity doth not depoſe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſe Reaſon: It doth refine and not ſubvert, and undermine it: And where a Man is not got ſo high, as the ſober uſe of his Reaſon, he is not fit to be a Diſciple of Chriſt: He that follows not the Light and Guidance of his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon for the main, when Senſe and Paſſion do oppoſe, and make head againſt it, though he hath the diſtinctive Faculty of a Man, yet is not a Man, in Uſe and Exerciſe, but a Brute: And he that's no Man, be ſure is no Chriſtian: But he that prefers his Body before his Soul, in the main Courſe of his Converſation, lives not ſo as the Light of Nature can direct him: The clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reaſon doth ſuggeſt, that the better part is to be principally looked after: And that a Man
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:134641:209"/>hath a Soul, as well as a Body, we need not go to Scripture for an Argument, as if there were no Light elſewhere to inform us: There be other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks common to us with Infidels and Heathen: Now the World is but the Accommodation of the Senſual Part, And he that cannot ſlight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn this, when it thwarts the Intereſt of his Better Part; He is ſo far from learning that which is ſupernatural in the Doctrin of Chriſt, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that he hath not learned that which is but Natural, and the Object of a lower Faculty: He is ſo far from the higher Acts of Faith, that he wants the lower Acts of Reaſon, and hath not the preſuppoſed Matter that's required to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> The Contempt of Earth and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things, lays an excellent Foundation for a cleer and piercing Underſtanding: For nothing doth ſo much dull and ſot the Intellect, as Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pleaſure, and Senſual Delight, which makes the Fleſh inſolent, the Paſſions maſterleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, the Mind liſtleſs and unfit to ſearch after wiſdom: And whilſt the Soul is daily offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſtreams of a Body drunk with Earthly Pleaſures, the vigor and ſprightfulneſs of it is quite extinguiſhed: And the underſtanding is quite perverted, and knows not how to diſcern and judge aright, when it is upon any ſearch: For nothing will enter ſuch a perverted Mind, or ſeem Credible, that doth any ways thwart this Carnal, Brutiſh Pleaſure: It's difficult, if not impoſſible, to ſee clearly in the Duſt of Riches, and Smoke of Honours: Beſides, Earthly Love betrays to Eaſe, Softneſs, and Intemperance, which are very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:134641:209"/>with an acute underſtanding: But the Contempt of ſuch ſenſual Pleaſures, inſpires the Mind with true Accuracy, and gives it a piercing Eye: For having now no hankering thoughts or deſires after theſe things, it's always fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and fix ſeriouſly upon any propoſed Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to ſee things in their proper Evidence; becauſe there is nothing to bribe the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſo it becomes impartial in its ſearch and examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> This forementioned diſdain of the World and its Pleaſures, makes a moſt ready way to inward Peace and Quietneſs: For theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Baits are the Inciters of our Paſſions, and when they are up, there is no Reſt, nor Quiet: That Man is like to be ſedate, calm and undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that doth not much care for any of theſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Comforts: There will be a pleaſant ſilence in the heart, when it is not provoked by the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Fleſh, which then will domineer, whilſt it hath there ſenſual Accommodations, but grows tame and tractable, when it is pretty well weaned, and weakened through the want of them, if other Neceſſaries do concur: Why art thou ſo patient, O my Soul! under the Rage and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering Power of the Fleſh, and its head-ſtrong Luſts? Why doeſt thou ſo frequently Conſent to the Love and Purſuit of ſuch poor, ſhort, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Felicity, that fills thee with ſo muſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and alienates thee from God, and doth ſo much deſtroy all thy future Hopes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It may help forward this Contempt of the World, to conſider ſeriouſly the vanity of Man, who is the Nobleſt Part of it: <hi>Verily, every
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:134641:210"/>Man</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) at his beſt Eſtate, is</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>All manner of Vanity:</hi> as it is in the Original. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.6. A Helpleſs Friend, and a Toothleſs Enemy: And therefore he that truſteth Man, maketh a broken Reed his Confidence: And he that hath an inordinate Fear of Man, feareth a ſhadow:

                  <hi>Who art thou,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>that art a fraid of a Man, that ſhall die, and of the Son of Man, that ſhall be made as Graſs?</hi> There's no ſadder Spectacle in the World than Man, if this were his beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and he had all he were to look for in this life: A Toad, or the moſt hated Creature, no nor thoſe that are continually hunted and purſued, and live always in danger of the Snare, or ſome cruel Device to take away their Lives, are not half ſo ſad a Spectacle as Man is, I mean without the Grace of God. Theſe Brutiſh Creatures neither apprehend, nor fear the Snare, till they are caught in it; nor foreſee a Michief, till it is at hand; nor vex themſelves with the Memory of what is paſt: But <hi>Reaſon</hi> which <hi>is Man's proper <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſil,</hi> makes him but the more capable Subject of Miſery and Torment, and helps him to ſuffer a Miſchief before it comes, and to feel it a long while after; This is ſuch a Faculty, as teacheth him to improve his Sufferings and Calamities, (which no other Creature that wants it can do) and to chew upon an Evil when it's ſwallowed down and paſt. Should a Believer fear the Frowns of ſuch a ſilly Creature, or regard his Favour? when he would threaten or tice him from his Duty! I conclude therefore, <hi>It's better to truſt
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:134641:210"/>in the Lord, than to put any confidence in man; yea, it is much better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes,</hi> Pſal. 118.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, O my Soul! what a meer Juggle and Deluſion is the Pleaſure of this World, with which thou haſt ſo often ſuffered thy ſelf to be couzened, and deceived? What Luggage is the Riches? And what a Blaſt is the Honour thereof? Yea, what a Dream and meer imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is all that here Men dote upon? Is it for this that Men ſwear and deceive, couzen and lye, ſweat and run about with fooliſh heat and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? Is this the Reward of all the buſle and ſtir they make?

               <p>Wonderful! that ever Men that have an Eye of Reaſon to diſcern thus much, ſhould yet ſuffer themſelves to be ſo beſooled!

So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth Eternity, (whoſe Name is Holy) I dwell in the High and Holy Place with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and the Heart of

               <p>There are ſome (though very few) that need to be warned and admoniſhed, that they do not place the Principal Part of God's Worſhip and Service, in Sighs, and Tears, and pricking Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſhameful Confeſſions of their Sin: (Not that I diſſwade any from giving due Time and Meaſure to theſe humbling, ſelf-abaſing Acts; For it is the deſign and buſineſs of this preſent Labour, to promote this Sorrow in the Heart, ſo far as it is a fit Inſtrument to promote Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Heart and Life.) But yet ſome, I ſay, have need of this Caution, that they lay not too much ſtreſs upon this part of our Duty we owe unto God; much leſs that they confine the whole work and buſineſs of Religion, to Acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and Mortification: For though the Lord delighteth in the penitent, broken Heart, that mourneth over all its former Sin and Folly, and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:134641:213"/>is aſhamed of his odious, hainous Tranſgreſſions, and doth loath himſelf for his Iniquities, and doth particularly ſearch into his Sores, and uncover them before God, with the moſt diſtinct, clear, and open Confeſſion; yet this is but a lower and preparatory ſtep, to that Love of God, conſtant delight in him, praiſes of him, chearful obedience to him in the which he is far more delighted: ſo that Tears, and Sorrow, and heart-melting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and afflicting our Souls, are not <hi>abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> pleaſing to God, and a part of the immutable, unchangeable Worſhip we owe to him, but only acceptable to him,</p>

               <p n="2">2. In preparation to future Obedience.</p>
               <p>Had we never ſinned, Sorrow and Repentance had been no acceptable Service to God at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would it have pleaſed him to ſee us go hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily as thoſe that mourn.</p>
               <p>But now, ſuppoſing that every one of us is born into the World with hereditary Corruption, and a depraved Nature, quite contrary to that which God gave Man at the firſt, the very firſt acceptable Service that we can perform to God, is to be ſenſible of and to bewail this perverſe Diſpoſition, according to its deſert, and to weigh, and conſider all the ſad and woful Conſequences of ſuch a poiſoned, corrupted Nature, how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is to God, how diſgraceful to our ſelves here, and how deſtructive to our ſouls hereafter, and how dangerous and infectious it is to others, that we are firmly reſolved to take any Courſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our former Freedom and Priviledge we had in the ſtate of Innocency, that God ſhall ſuggeſt

                  <hi>Two great Advantages:</hi> 1.

               <p n="2">2. They that make it their whole endeavour to weep and mourn and afflict themſelves for their ſins, will thereby diſable both Body and Soul for any Service of God at all, and both deſtroy their Bodily Health, and overthrow their Reaſon: And ſo whilſt they are bewailing their Sin, and as they think are conquering of it, they do but entangle themſelves the more, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:134641:214"/>waſte that ſtrength that ſhould mortifie and ſubdue it.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why God doth ſpeak ſo much in his Word, in approbation of the ſorrowful, broken and contrite Heart, which I doubt is the Reaſon of theſe Mens miſtake, is becauſe ſuch Perſons have need of ſuch Encouragement, and might otherwiſe faint under the Anguiſh and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their Spirits, and therefore becauſe he would not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax, till he hath brought forth Judgment unto Victory, He gives theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials to ſuch as are under the Pangs of the New Birth: But he had much rather that Men would leave the Principles of the Doctrin of Chriſt, and not ſtick always at the Foundation of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Dead Works, and of Faith towards God: Not that we are to ſhake hands with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſorrow for Sin, after we are once heartily converted, unleſs we could be ſure to commit no more ſin: But then ſin will need a more ſhort and tranſient ſorrow, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bewail it ſo ſoon as ever it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, But our firſt Repentance and Sorrow will coſt us hotter Water, and put us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e trouble.</p>
               <p>If a Man that hath a long Journey to go, ſhould ſet out a quite contrary way to the place whither he is to go, and ſo travel on, till he hath ſpent half or more of the time that is allotted for his Journey, you muſt needs think that will coſt him more vexation and trouble to get into his right way, than after he is gotten in, if he ſhould chance to ſtep out a Mile or two: A ſmall Errour
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:134641:215"/>is more ſpeedily corrected than a great one of long continuance: But yet it is always true, That it's better to prevent ſin, and keep out of it at the firſt, than to get out of it by Repentance: Though by Accident, and through the Mercy of God, it may ſometimes prove better to the ſinner, that he did fall into ſin, if he doth afterwards heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repent of it: But abſolutely, and in it ſelf, it is not better: And he that ſhould preſume to let looſe the Reigns to Sin upon that account, I believe would find it much worſe.</p>
               <p>But before I produce thoſe Conſiderations, which, through the Bleſſing of God, may ſtir up and ſtrengthen this Affection, which muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> which lays the Foundation for all Joy and Peace, I will firſt ſhew what this Godly Sorrow doth imply, or what Acts are included in it, if it be ſuch as will work Repentance never to be repented of. And here let me Note, That Repentance is ſometimes taken by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> for the whole Work of Converſion, and then it includes Faith in it: ſo it's taken <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7. — <hi>There ſhall be joy in Heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons that need no repentance.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh:</hi> where Faith alſo is implied. So <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. —<hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life:</hi> where Repentance is named as the only condition of Life, which without Faith alſo in Chriſt cannot be had, and therefore it is included.</p>
               <p>Sometime Repentance is taken only for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and then uſually Faith is joyned with it.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:134641:215"/>So <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. <hi>Teſtifying to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in this latter ſenſe, I here take the word Repentance when I make uſe of it: And ſo <hi>Repentance, or Godly Sorrow,</hi> is a deliberate Act of the Soul, performed upon the Motions or by the Aſſiſtance of the good Spirit of God, whereby a Man being touched with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Sorrow and Remorſe, for all that he hath ſinned, whither in his Parents, or in himſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwardly, and in ſecret, or elſe openly, and in the ſight of Men, is now reſolved to cloſe with Chriſt, as his only Remedy againſt the Guilt and Power of it. So that you may perceive by this Deſcription, that <hi>ſincere Repentance, and Sorrow for Sin,</hi> muſt imply theſe following Acts, or otherwiſe it can never be an adviſed and deliberate Act, nor conclude in a firm reſolution and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to take Chriſt as his only ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It implys a deep Conviction of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God and his ſin-hating Nature: And that you may as ſoon reconcile Light and Darkneſs, as God and the leaſt Sin, whether you take it in its Material or Formal Conſideration: In its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Conſideration, it's nothing but Deformity, and Abſurdity, and Contradiction, to all Right and Reaſon: And in its Formal Reſpect, it's a thwarting God's Will, (that's ſupreme, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned with infinite wiſdom) and a breach of his righteous Law: And in both theſe Reſpects, it muſt needs be the Object of Divine Hatred and Abhorrence: ſurely he muſt needs abhor to ſee a Creature croſs his own Will, and oppoſe his own
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:134641:216"/>Government; and when he hath endued him with reaſon, to ſee him act ſo abſurdly: Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>That ſuch as are fooliſh, cannot ſtand in his ſight, he hateth all the workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſalm 5.5. And if an imperfect Saint, ſuch a one as <hi>David,</hi> hath ſuch an averſation to ſuch Works, and the doers of them, that he can ſay, <hi>depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity,</hi> much more doth he that is of ſpotleſs purity, hate all Filthineſs and Pollution, which every ſinner hath ſome degree of: If the Lord were not an utter Enemy to all Iniquity, he had never turned ſo many Angels out of Heaven for their ſin, nor prepared ſuch a place of endleſs and unſufferable Torment, for ſuch as are found guilty of it in the General Account: He had never brought ſuch a Deluge upon the old World, and ſwept away all of them, ſave Eight Perſons; Nor dropt down ſuch a conſuming Fire upon thoſe Four Citys, and the Inhabitants thereof, Man, Woman and Child, if he had not been a bitter Enemy to ſin: If you ſhould ſee a Father that tenderly loves his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bears a moſt dear Affection to them, to perſecute them to the Death, and expreſs the greateſt Cruelty towards them: you would ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that it muſt be ſome high Provocation that can thus prevail to extinguiſh ſuch inbred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection to them: And if you could be conſident that he were a juſt and righteous Perſon, that would not do ſuch a cruel Act without a great and weighty Cauſe; you muſt then ſay, That they muſt be guilty of ſome horrid Act, that can thus turn the Bowels of ſuch a tender Father, and exaſperate them into ſuch a rage. The Caſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:134641:216"/>is the ſame here, only with this difference, that God hath infinitely more love and tender bowels to us his Creatures and the Workmanſhip of his Hands, than the tendereſt Father or Mother here upon Earth: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking chila, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? yea, they may forget, but I will not forget:</hi> And yet what terrible and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Judgments doth he execute upon ſome of them, both here and hereafter? Not only ſingle Perſons, but whole Nations: yea, how dreadful, and heavy is his hand upon thoſe that are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not only by Creation, but Regeneration alſo, inſomuch that they often complain, that the Arrows of the Almighty ſtick faſt in them, and drink up their Spirits, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. Thus <hi>Job, David, Heman,</hi> and many others of God's deareſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have complained: Can any Man of reaſon ever think, that ever God thus deals with them, without ſome great and weighty Cauſe? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is ſo certain, that Fury dwelleth not in him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 27.4. And he cannot be moved by any of thoſe wild, irrational, and ungoverned Paſſions as Man is: He that believes not this, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believes that there is no God, or elſe knows not what ſuch a Being doth eſſentially involve: But yet though we have a fall, certainly that God is more tender and affectionate to Men, than any Father or Mother in the World, yet it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he loveth Righteouſneſs, and Equity, and Truth, more than all the Creatures in the World; becauſe theſe are a part of his own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but Creatures are not: And therefore he ſtands obliged to vindicate theſe though it be with
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:134641:217"/>the Ruin of all Mankind: And thus he would certainly do, even deſtroy all the Works of his Hands, if his righteous Law (which is but the Tranſcript of his Nature, could not be otherwiſe righted: He can make another World, with a Word of his Mouth: But he cannot make, as I may ſay, with reverence, another God: Every ſin ſtrikes at the very Being of God, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the very Apple of his Eye; And therefore the Word of God tells us plainly, That Sin is the only Make-bate between God and his Creatures, that hath pull'd down all thoſe heavy Calamities, and Judgments, upon the World, that ever we read or heard of. But the Death of his only Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son, for the Sins of the World, which he took upon him to expiate and ſatisfie for, is ſuch a demonſtration of God's deadly and implacable Hatred againſt all Sin and Ungodlineſs, that no Man in reaſon ſhould ever after doubt of it. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that is truly penitent, and ſorry for his ſin, is apprehenſive of this in ſome good Meaſure. And this is the <hi>Firſt Act</hi> that Godly Sorrow and Repentance doth imply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He that unfeignedly grieveth for his ſin, muſt be very ſenſible how diſhonourable it is to God: I know it's beyond the reach of any Creature to do him any real Diſhonour; But yet doth he not loſe his Reputation amongſt Men, by every ſin that is committed? Are not ſome or other animated thereby to do the like; or elſe if it be ſecretly committed, is not the ſinner himſelf more hardned thereby, and diſpoſed to more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, unworthy Apprehenſions of God? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he is. He cannot think him ſo holy, juſt,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:134641:217"/>and righteous as he is, becauſe Judgment is not ſpeedily executed on him: And how doth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil triumph, and all thoſe malicious Spirits that attend him, to ſee a Child ſo unnatural to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as every ſinner is to God? How doth it feed his Malice and Pride, to ſee him make a Creature that cares ſo little for him, as every ſinner doth? He that is affected with his ſin to purpoſe, knows and is cut to the heart, for the diſhonour done to him by his ſin, and that he hath ſo much ſtained his holy Attributes and Perfections, and miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He that is truly penitent for his ſin, is deeply ſenſible of thoſe great Obligations he lies under, to perform a perfect obedience to God: He is his Creature, I, and the chief of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this lower World, made on purpoſe for his ſervice, ſhaped in his own likeneſs, fitted for it, encouraged to it: That can never be happy, but in his Favour, and therefore was ſufficiently concerned to ſeek and prize it above all things: And to ſhun and avoid ſin, whereby he muſt needs loſe it. All Creatures upon Earth were placed at his Feet, and put into his Hands, to give him their beſt Aſſiſtance and Encouragement for this Service. The good and welfare of the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour World depended upon his Obedience to God, and the obſervance of that Law he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon his very Nature: And therefore ſo ſoon as ever he ſinned, he involved all the Creatures that were made ſubject to him in the ſame Curſe and Condemnation: ſo that the whole Creation is now in Bondage, and groans to be delivered into the glorious Liberty of God's Children:
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:134641:218"/>
                  <hi>And the earneſt expectation of the Creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.19, 21, 22. Never was any Child ſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obſerve the Will of his Father, Nor any Subject to Obey his rightful Prince and Soveraign, Nor any Slave and Vaſſal to fulfil the Command of his Lord, as we are to do the Will of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: But what do I make ſuch a Compariſon as this? There's a thouſand fold more obligation upon us to tender a perfect Obedience to God, than there can be upon any Subject, or Child, or Servant, to obey the ſtricteſt Laws of the beſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord or Sovereign here on Earth: And yet what Man ſo mad, as to incur their diſpleaſure, if they can help it? Or who would not waſh away ſuch an Offence with many Tears, if there were any hope to find Mercy and Favour with them in ſuch a Caſe: How much more would a ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his Offences committed againſt him that is his Creatour, and Sovereign, and hath abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him, and the power of Eternal Life and Death in his hands; Thou canſt not endure his diſpleaſure, if he doth but frown: Nor live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his favour, if he ſhould totally withdraw it but an hour: As he commandeth the Sun to ſhed his light and influence upon thee, ſo he clotheth the Heaven with blackneſs, and maketh Sackcloth their covering when he pleaſeth, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50.3. If thou didſt but know and conſider the one half of the infinite Mercies he doth beſtow upon thee, and the worth of them, it would make thee ſure to break into bitter complaints, for all thy odious Tranſgreſſions, eſpecially when thou knoweſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, That the Penitent are ſo ſure to ſpeed, and find Mercy with him.</p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:134641:218"/>
               <p>This is a <hi>Third Act,</hi> That Godly Sorrow, if it be ſincere, doth imply, even a deep ſenſe of all the Obligations every one of us lies under to abſtain from all Appearance of Evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He that would bewail his ſin aright, muſt be ſenſible how ſhameful it is and deſtructive to his own Soul and Body: It prevents his Reaſon, and makes him far more vile than a Creature that wants that Faculty; It animates his Senſes to all inſolency; it makes his Paſſions maſterleſs and unruly; it deſtroys the Health of the Body, the Peace and Compoſure of the Mind; it fills the Conſcience with perpetual Remorſe and Unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And all theſe Effects do as naturally flow from it, as Poyſon doth from a Toad or Serpent; And thus it would puniſh it ſelf, although God ſhould inflict no other puniſhment than what will inevitably follow ſuch ſinful, inordinate Acts, and ſuch abuſe of the Reaſon and Faculties that Man is poſſeſſed of. It procures the hatred of God, and the ſhame of Men, and breeds a continual Worm at home, that will gnaw in twain the Thred of this Life, and will then feed upon Soul and Body, to their everlaſting pain and torment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He that is truly penitent, and doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his ſin, as he ought, doth know and conſider the Merit of his ſin, and what Wages it deſerves: He is ſenſible that the leaſt ſin committed againſt ſuch a Majeſty, by a Creature ſo much obliged and enabled to the contrary, deſerves damnation, and that he can make God no recompence for the wrong and injury it doth him. And he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands in ſome good meaſure, what Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:134641:219"/>doth imply: And then when he calls to mind the infinite Number he hath committed, and how oft he hath deſerved ſuch a dreadful Reward, and that yet he is invited to Repentance, and knows that he ſhall find Mercy, if he repent from the bottom of his Heart; This melts him into Tears, and diſſolveth his rocky Heart, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to feel, what heretofore he made light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> As the penitent ſinner is ſenſible of all the foregoing Particulars, ſo he is acquainted with his own perſonal Tranſgreſſions; not only that he is a ſinner in general, but what actual wickedneſs he is every day guilty of. How little his Thoughts, Words or Actions come up to the Rule at the beſt, and how often they utterly thwart and contradict the Rule, and what are his Maſter-Corruptions, and where the ſtrength of his ſin lies; He is alſo deeply ſenſible of his ſinful Nature, that he brought with him into the World; and how croſs it is to the Will of God expreſſed in his Word and Law, and altogether unlike the Nature that God gave Man at the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He doth hereupon judge himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding vile, and even loath himſelf for his Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. When he thinketh upon his odious ways, he is heartily aſhamed, and counteth himſelf unworthy of any outward Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and wondreth at the Mercies that God doth beſtow ſo contrary to his deſerts. He ſeriouſly judgeth himſelf more wretched and miſerable, by reaſon of his ſin, and an Object of greater ſhame and contempt, than if he had liv'd in the greateſt poverty and want without ſin; as knowing that
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:134641:219"/>one makes him contemptible only to ſuch as judge according to outward appearance, but the other to thoſe that judge righteous judgment. He knows, that ſin makes him a Beaſt or a Devil in Humane ſhape, and is a Diſgrace and Reproach to all his Faculties, and quite perverts the very frame and deſign of them. For what is ſin, but an abſurd and unreaſonable Act? <hi>(Actus debito ordine privatus,)</hi> as the School-men define it, and ſuppoſeth the Senſes and their Objects to be in chief power and command, and the nobler Part, (I mean his Rational and Immortal Spirit) to be chained up, and lye by as a Priſoner in Fetters, or which is worſe, to be a voluntary Servant and Drudge, to the ſtinking corruptible part of Man: What Lord, that hath the Spirit of a Man, would endure to be a drudge to his Servant? It's a ſad ſight to ſee a Prince a Captive to his Subjects, or a Lord to be in the hand and power of his Slaves, led up and down in Chains at the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him, that is but of a baſe and degenerate Breed, compared with himſelf. It was a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of <hi>Job</hi>'s pitiful Condition, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible perſons had him in deriſion, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he would have diſdained to have ſet with the Doggs of his Flock, <hi>Job</hi> 30.1. That Children of Fools and Baſe Men, that were viler than the Earth, made him their Song, and By-word, and that they did abhor him, and flee far from him, and not ſpare to ſpit in his Face, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. It was a very doleful, pitiful ſight, to ſee <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, ſo barbarouſly entreated by <hi>Gourney,</hi> and made to ſit upon a Mole-hill, whilſt the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhaved him, and to take cold Water out of a
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:134641:220"/>Ditch, to waſh him with; which the patient King ſeeing, told them, that in deſpight of them, he would have warm Water at his Barbing, and therewithal poured down Tears in abundance: It's a much ſadder Spectacle, to ſee Senſe trample upon Reaſon, and the Fleſh that is of ſo baſe a deſcent, to domineer over the Soul, that's born of God, and is of the Blood-Royal, made to rule and govern, as the very <hi>Heathen</hi> could tell: <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi imperio, Corporis ſervitio, utimur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salaſt.</hi> And what's the Fruit of ſuch a Monſtrous Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when Fleſh and Senſe do exerciſe ſuch an oppreſſive uſurping Power, and that Faculty that makes a Man is perfectly cow'd? Why, This unſpeakable Miſchief is the Fruit thereof; Earth is preferr'd before Heaven; The Creature before the Creator; The momentary pleaſures of Sin, before the durable and everlaſting Felicity; And Men chuſe rather to be Termers in theſe decaying Comforts, that expire with their Lives, than to have the Propriety of an Eternal Inheritance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that ſhall never be out-dated: Theſe and the like Conſiderations make the ſinner to judge himſelf a vile Perſon, a Reproach to Humane Nature, a ſhameful Spectacle to God, Angels and Men; Better he judgeth it a thouſand times, that God had made him a Beaſt, rather than that he ſhould have made himſelf a Beaſt: If you judge not Sin to be the greateſt evil to you, and a greater diſparagement than Poverty and Raggs, and all the reproach and ſcorn of Men barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves without ſin, you cannot have that ſorrow for ſin which is ſincere; For it's abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that ſorrow for ſin, committed
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:134641:220"/>againſt God, be greater than all other ſorrow for worldly Calamities whatſoever, (as to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part of it, which is in the Intellect and Will, though perchance not as to that part of ſorrow which is in the ſenſitive part, and is it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Tears, or thoſe ſenſible Perturbations of the Body which we uſually call by the Name of Paſſions:) And how is it poſſible that there ſhould bean intellectual ſorrow greater than all other ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, unleſs it be firſt truly judged to be the greateſt diſgrace and ſhame to us of any thing that can befal us, and doth neceſſarily draw after it more evil and miſchief to Body and Soul, than the World can inflict on us? It's poſſible for a Man to have great inward Peace and Content, and an excellent Spirit, that is the object of the World's contempt and ſcorn: Our Saviour had no Form nor Comelineſs in him, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> 53.2. And yet he was <hi>ſpecioſus prae Filiis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum;</hi> Fairer than the Children of Men: (1.) for internal, but not external Endowments, ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 45.2. And as the ſinner that's wounded with hearty ſorrow for his ſin, doth thus judge of himſelf and doth ſay, He is a Worm and no Man, a Reproach of Men, and worthily deſpiſed by the People, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.6. So he doth adjudge himſelf to the greateſt ſufferings, and counts it an unſpeakable Favour to be admitted to Repentance, and that he may be received into Favour with God again upon any Terms: This is <hi>Another Act</hi> that Godly Sorrow doth contain and is made up of.</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:134641:221"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The Soul that's truly penitent, is deeply diſpleaſed with himſelf, and wiſheth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily he had never been guilty of ſuch Folly: And if it were to do again, would venture upon any ſuffering or ſhame, rather than give his Conſent thereto; He is fallen out with himſelf ſo far as he is tainted with Corruption, and upbraids himſelf with all his Rebellion and Ingratitude againſt God, and his unrighteous and unbrotherly Practices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, and ill Government of himſelf; He is heartily willing to grieve for his Sin, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that grief by all ſignificant ſigns that either Nature or Scripture doth ſuggeſt to him, and to uſe all Means whereby this Grief may be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as by Faſting, and hard Uſage of his Body, when it may be a probable Means to promote this Repentance of his Heart. Whatever is like to make his Heart more Tender and Senſible of his Sin he is willing to ſubmit to. He is willing to take a frequent view of his loathſom ſin, that he might more deeply abhor himſelf. He is willing that God ſhould afflict him in that meaſure that his Wiſdom ſees moſt fit, if he will but kill his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions thereby. And that Men think of him as he hath deſerved; And when he cannot weep in reality, he weepeth in deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> And as the Underſtanding and Will do thus far conquer to produce this Repentance and Sorrow; ſo there will be ſome degree and meaſure of the Paſsions, properly ſo called, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in ſuch a true Penitent. There will be Grief, and Shame for the Offence, and Fear of him whom thou haſt offended, and longing deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:134641:221"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then Tenthly,</hi> He that hath a truly penitent Heart, and the Sorrow of the right ſtamp, will expreſs it by all outward Signs for the Honour of God and the Good of others; He will accuſe and ſpeak evil of himſelf, and humble himſelf by Confeſſion before God, his ſhameful Iniquities; Neither will he ſpare to lay open the ſhame of his particular ſins, ſo far as he knoweth them: Nay, his pride is ſo far taken down, that he will not ſtick to make Confeſſion of them before Men, if it be ſuch ſins whereby they have wronged their Souls, and hardned them in any ſinful courſe; They will endeavour to undo what they have done, by their penitent Confeſſions; and remove the ſcandal, as much as lyeth in their power, though it coſt them ſhame: It's a good ſign that their ſorrow for ſin is ſincere, when it puts them upon ſuch outward Acts, as have a ſtrong tendency to condemn and diſgrace their former ſinful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And they may well ſuſpect themſelves and their Repentance, that ſtick at ſuch diſgraceful Acts as Confeſſion is: And are content that God ſhould want the Honour that's given to him, by an humble acknowledgment of our vileneſs and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins; And that Men ſhould want, ſuch an Argument, againſt the like ſinful Courſes for the time to come, than that themſelves ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a little diſgrace and ſhame: I ſay, not that ſins of a fouler nature, that would tend to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Goſpel, that were committed in ſecret, ſhould be publickly made known at all: It may ſuffice, that ſuch are confeſſed before God, and the Perſons that are already privy to them: And that we do proteſt to them our unfeigned
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:134641:222"/>Grief for ſuch foul Tranſgreſſions, and our readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to give them all ſatisfaction for any Wrong or Injury done them. But the wrong that we have done to our Aſſociates and Companions, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Sabbath, Oaths, Ribbaldry, or any other infectious Courſes we are to beg pardon for, of them whom we have thus wronged, by our Miſcarriages; And to confeſs the ſinfulneſs of ſuch Courſes, to the Glory of God, and to the preventing of ſuch Evil for the future: And as the penitent, humble Perſon, will not ſtick at Confeſſion, both to God, and Men, when need requireth; ſo he will with patience and ſilence ſubmit himſelf to any Afflictions that the righteous God, whom he hath provoked, doth think meet to inflict upon him: He doth not mutter in his Heart, as knowing, that he hath deſerved the moſt calamitous afflicted Life in this World, and the unſupportable Miſeries of the other Life: Should a Malefactour, that hath forfeited his Life, murmur at the Judge that puniſheth him with a few ſtripes, and ſo remits the other part of his puniſhment? <hi>I will patiently bear the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.9. <hi>A truly penitent Heart will not complain for the puniſhment of his ſin, Lam.</hi> 3.39. What do I ſay, he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? Nay, he will juſtifie God in all that he brings upon him: And as he doth expreſs his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by humble Confeſſion of his Sins, and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his Judge, ſo he will do it by peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Tears, if the Temper and Conſtitution of his Body will yield them. I do not ſay, that Tears are always an inſeparable Concomitant of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:134641:222"/>But unfeigned ſorrow for ſin, if it be in that degree, that our ſin requireth, will for the moſt part produce Tears: What a Flood did St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> pour forth at his firſt Converſion? The ſtory is very remarkable, you may find it in his Confeſſions: After he had ſtrugled with himſelf a good while, and had met with ſtiff oppoſition from the World and the Fleſh, with the Luſts thereof, that he was given to, which were ſtill tugging and drawing to keep their hold of him; But the good Man knowing that they would prove his utter deſtruction, if they were not forſaken, prayed earneſtly to God, to deliver him from their Bondage; And hearing by <hi>Pontition,</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Courtier, of the virtuous Life of St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> a Man of little Learning, but of ſtrict and exemplary Piety, began to be more enflamed with a deſire after Converſion: And walking in a Garden, with his Friend <hi>Alipius,</hi> he crys out to him, <hi>Quid hoc eſt? Quid patimur? Sargunt indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti, &amp;c.</hi> (1.) What's the Matter? What unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Men are we? Poor, ſimple, illiterate Men, Riſe up, and get the Kingdom of Heaven by force, and we with all our Learning, wallow in the Mire of Luſt and Corruption. Afterwards, going forth into an Orchard, all his former pleaſures muſtered up, and ſeemed to preſent themſelves before his Eyes; and thus to ſet upon him, <hi>Dimitteſne nos, &amp; a momento iſto, &amp;c.</hi> What wilt thou leave us quite, And muſt we never after this time ſee thee any more? What filth, ſaith he, and ſhameful pleaſures did they lay before mine Eyes, which he entreated God to pardon: At length, after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious difficult Conflict, a marvellous Tempeſt of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:134641:223"/>Tears came upon him, and Rivers of Water ran down his Eyes, as he lay under a Figg-tree, and there he poured forth his Soul to God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and threw off his beloved Luſts and Corruptions, and never returned to them any more:</p>
               <p>All theſe Acts muſt concur, where there is true ſorrow for ſin, ſuch as the Goſpel doth require as a condition, without which there can be no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs: though perchance every one of theſe diſtinct Acts may not be taken notice of by him that is ſincerely penitent, yet he feeleth the force and power of them in his afflicted broken Heart. But yet ſome of the forgoing Acts that are in the underſtanding, it may be, ſtick cloſer than the others, and prevail more to bring on the after Acts that are in the Will and Affections, and are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the outward Actions: But though ſome degrees of this forementioned Sorrow may and do always go before <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> yet your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is never compleated and perfected, till Chriſt be heartily cloſed with, and received with loving ſubjection of the Soul; for then the Soul is enabled by the Spirit, that he beſtoweth to <hi>bring forth</hi> that Repentance which it had <hi>brought but to the Birth</hi> before: There muſt be ſome ſenſe of the evil of ſin, and fear of God's diſpleaſure, and the miſeries that it already hath and will moreover bring upon us, and ſome loathing of a Man's ſelf, before ever Chriſt will be welcome to you, and before you will conſent that he ſhall be your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord and Saviour; and take his Yoke on you: You muſt feel the intolerableneſs of the other Yoke of Sin and Satan, before you will
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:134641:223"/>change it for Chriſt's, and come to him for eaſe and Relief. So that you ſee ſome Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are preparatory to Faith, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Such as Self-love and the Fear of Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can produce: But it is the Love of God in Chriſt that muſt kindly melt the Heart for ſin, and antidote it againſt the poyſon thereof for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſettle the Reſolution to forſake it, and follow after holineſs, whereby the ſoul is made like to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much for the Nature of Repentance,</hi> or what Acts it is made up of. I come next to the <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi> that ſhould provoke and ſtir up this Holy Affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then; Conſider the flat neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without which there is no Pardon, nor Peace with God to be expected: whatever he diſpenſe withal, this he will not diſpenſe with: He hath indeed diſpenſed with the Law of Works that required perfect ſinleſs Obedience, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Damnation: And hath promiſed thee, that thou ſhalt not dye, nor the threatning be executed on thee, if thou wilt ſubmit to the Goſpel, or the New Law of Chriſt thy Redeemer: That is, in other words, if thou wilt from thy Heart acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy ſins and repent of them, and come to Chriſt for ſtrength and reſolution to forſake them: But he will never diſpenſe with thee here, in caſe thou wilt not ſubmit to this gracious offer: Thy ſins muſt be felt, and that more than all worldly ſufferings, otherwiſe Chriſt will be no Phyſician to thee, nor ſhalt thou ever feel the admirable power of his Blood: Thy ſin muſt be felt either
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:134641:224"/>here by Repentance, or elſe hereafter in eternal Deſparation: Now the ſtain and filthineſs of thy moſt hainous ſins, may be waſhed out by the Blood of Chriſt, if thou comeſt with a penitent Heart to that ſovereign, healing Fountain: But then the ſtain can never be got out, nor thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach be ever wiped away, though thou ſhouldſt pour forth Rivers of Tears: Behold, I have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told thee, Let not thy Heart deceive thee, nor think that after thou haſt diſpleaſed God ſo often by thy ſin, that thou mayeſt ſcape and find Mercy, though thou art never heartily diſpleaſed with thy ſelf for thy fooliſh, ſhameful ways: Never any perſon found favour with God, nor obtained Mercy, that did not drink of this bitter Potion of Repentance, and was not more afflicted in Heart and Soul for Diſobedience to God, than for any worldly Miſery that ever befel him: It is an unpleaſant work to a Man yet in his ſins, and a narrow paſſage unto life, but he that will enter into the Heavenly Kingdom, muſt paſs through this ſtreight Gate; The bitterneſs of this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will quickly be over, but the unſpeakable comfort thereof (if it be ſound, and enable thee to forſake thy ſins) will abide with thee for ever: Who would not ſubmit to hard Terms, to ſave his Eſtate, (though it were never ſo little) or his Life, though it were unhealthy and uncomfortable? But who would not conſent to harder Terms, to procure a more plentiful Eſtate, and a more health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, comfortable Life? And is there any thing more neceſſary, or doth half ſo much concern thee, as to have God thy reconciled Friend, and to ſave thy Soul from Eternal Death, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thy ſelf from
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:134641:224"/>utter deſtruction of Body and Soul for ever and ever? And to get the poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Joy? Conſider, I beſeech, O my Soul! And do not reject the offer of Repentance, leſt the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal coſt thee a Repentance a thouſand times more ſharp and bitter: The pangs of the New Birth will quickly end, and then thou wilt begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that a Soul is born into the Spiritual World: And then thou wilt forget all thy former Sighs and Groans and Fears, and the bitter Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thy Soul, becaufe God hath now anſwered thee in the joy of thy Heart; And taken thee into his ſpecial care, and pardoned all thy ſin, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.20. Or if thou beeſt one that hath paſs'd the New Birth already, thy ſpeedy repentance after ſin committed, will be like a Shower in Summer, after the Ground is parched with heat and drought. The Winter-Rain, though the Ground be well ſoaked therewith, may indeed prepare the Earth to bring forth its Encreaſe, which Men expect from it in Summer and Harveſt; But if there fall not ſome Showers now and then, eſpecially after vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hot Seaſons, all the hopes of a good Harveſt, may come to nought: So it is in the Caſe of ſin; your firſt Repentance and Tears, are like the Winter-Rain, that is of long continuance, and doth throughly ſoak into the Heart, and make it ſoft and fertile: But your after-Repentance is like the Summer-Showers, and the more the heat is parched with ſin, and hardned through the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of Proſperity, the more it muſt be watered, with freſh Showers of Holy Repentance and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or elſe you will loſe your hopes of Future Joy and Happineſs: Seeing then the Neceſſity of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:134641:225"/>a firſt and after Repentance, refuſe not the Mercy that's offered to thee upon ſuch fair Terms: For ſhame diſown that Faculty of Sorrow and Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if it will not ſerve thee, and ſtand thee in ſtead in this greateſt Neceſſity: Shall thine Eyes trickle, and run down with Tears, if thou haſt but loſt a dear Friend and Acquaintance? Yea, if thou haſt but parted with him for a time, and haſt not quite loſt him, or her? And ſhall not thy Heart melt, and thine Eyes pour down, when God is departed from thee, though it ſhould be but for a certain time. Alas! thou wanteſt him every Moment, more than thou canſt do the moſt uſeful, helpful Friend, that ever thou hadſt in the World: And if thou knoweſt not thus much; the greater is thy need of repentance and ſorrow, for ſuch a wicked, deadly ignorance, as this will prove, if the Tears of Repentance do not clear thine Eyes, and cauſe thee better to ſee and underſtand what need thou haſt of the Divine Grace and Comfort every hour: And then thou wilt be as ready to ſay as <hi>David, I am poor and needy, make haſt unto me, O God; Thou art my help, and my deliverer: make no long tarrying, O my God,</hi> Pſalm 70.5. And when thou haſt well conſidered, and had a little more experience, thou wilt ſay as he did, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs the Lord had been my help, my ſoul had long ſince dwelt in ſilence,</hi> (1) death, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94.17. It's eaſie to ſee if thou regardeſt either Scripture or Experience; <hi>That in the multitude of thy troubleſome thoughts within, he only can comfort and rejoyce thy ſoul,</hi> Pſalm 94.19. If thou canſt not therefore weep in the want and abſence of him, better thou hadſt had no Eyes, nor a Faculty to ſigh or weep: Yea, the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:134641:225"/>very Children of the Bride-chamber, though they have no need to weep whilſt the Bride-groom is with them, (that is) whilſt they ſeel the effects of God's gracious Preſence and Favour: yet when the Bride-groom is gone from them, and driven away by ſome ſinful, unkind uſage, in theſe days they muſt mourn, or the Comforter will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again. How much more muſt they weep, that are none of the Children of the Bride-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that never yet repented in all their life? Well, there is no Remedy, <hi>Except you repent, you will certainly periſh,</hi> Luke 13.3, 5. This is the <hi>Firſt Conſideration,</hi> to provoke Repentance and to ſtir up this Affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider how fooliſhly thou haſt done, and then refrain thy deepeſt Sorrow and Tears, if thou art able: This Conſideration ſtirr'd up <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s repentance, after that carnal confidence and diſtruſt of God, he had been guilty of, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the People: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>And</hi> David<hi>'s heart ſmote him, after he had numbred the People; And</hi> David <hi>ſaid unto the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done: And now I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy ſervant; for I have done</hi> very fooliſhly. Is it not a ridiculous, <hi>fooliſh Act,</hi> to ſet our ſtrength and wit againſt him that made us? For the Stubble to quarrel with the Fire? And the Duſt to fight againſt the Wind, that ſcattereth it on the Face of the Earth? 'Tis juſt ſuch a piece of wiſdom, to provoke God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, And when he calls, to give him no anſwer: And when he hath given us a Law to direct us how to live; Never ſeriouſly to enquire what it is, nor to trouble our ſelves with ſuch Thoughts:
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:134641:226"/>If an Earthly Maſter ſhould command his Servant, to do any thing that were juſt and reaſonable, and he ſhould peremptorily refuſe to do it; you would call that plain Rebellion, and ſay that Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be uſed accordingly: And is it much better, do you think, if he ſhould ſend him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions written in black and white, what he would have him do; And he ſhould let them lye by, and never read them? Wilful ignorance, of what we may, and are bound to know, lives at next door, to direct and open Contradiction and Rebellion: Now judge whether that Man be not void of underſtanding, or ſtark mad, That dare ſtand up and contradict, and ſay he will not obey, when God commands him: I know there's not a Man believes there is a God, and knows what he is, that dares ſay plainly, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey him?</hi> Exod. 5.2. But are there not many thouſands that will go their ways, and never conſider or regard what God commands them? I would it were not a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Caſe: And Mens ordinary courſe in the World: And what's the reaſon that Men are ſo exceeding bold and adventurous? The plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, <hi>becaufe they are fooliſh Children and have no knowledge; they are ſottiſh, and have no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Jer. 4.22. And yet it follows, <hi>They are wiſe enough to do evil, but to do good they have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> What canſt thou ſay for thy ſelf, that art yet an impenitent wretch? If thou art one that doeſt believe thou haſt a Soul to ſave, and a God to ſerve, and that the Day is coming when thou muſt account for theſe things, and yet regardeſt them not, will not thy Tongue be forced to ſay,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:134641:226"/>thou haſt done very fooliſhly? Is he not a Fool that neglects his greateſt Concernments, and ſpendeth all his Time without any Thoughts of them? Suppoſe a Merchant ſhould ſend a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour into a far Countrey, to negotiate his Affairs, and tranſact his Buſineſs there, and to carry on his Trade with the Inhabitants of that Countrey; and there ſhould live gallantly upon the Coſt and Expences of his Maſter that ſent him: and when he ſhould return home, ſhould bring in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, So much ſpent in Meat and Drink, ſo much in Apparel, ſo much in Entertainments, and other Recreations; and when he came to the main point in hand, the Buſineſs on which he was purpoſely ſent, could give none, or but a ſlight and careleſs Account thereof, would you not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a fooliſh Factour, and that Merchant a worſe Fool, that ſhould imploy ſuch a one again, without any Signs of Repentance, and hopes of his Amendment? Shall I liken their Folly to this, (yea, it is incomparably greater) that come hither into the World on purpoſe to ſerve their Maker, and live in obedience to his Laws, and yet do nothing leſs: Should God call thee now to an account, Is it not the plain truth, that thy Thoughts have been upon this Vanity and that Vanity; And thine Affections have run after every Shadow; And thy time hath been ſpent in the drudgery of the Fleſh, in providing for thy Carcaſs; And the main Deſign upon which thou art ſent into the World, ſhamefully neglected? I know it is duty to think upon, and labour after Temporal things, <hi>and in the ſweat of thy face, to eat thy bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. But is it not damnable Folly,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:134641:227"/>to labour after the Food that periſheth, more than that which endureth? To ſpend thy days in ſinful, fooliſh Merriment, and then to go down to the place of Eternal Miſery? Can that Man go for any other than a Fool, in thine account, that will not be perſwaded to conſider, that for his good now, which he muſt unavoidably conſider to his hurt and miſchief hereafter? It's one known dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a Wiſeman and a Fool, that the one provideth for a Miſchief while time ſerveth; and the other would do it when it is too late: And it is another undoubted Character of a Fool, to prefer the chacing of a Feather, before the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of himſelf with the richeſt Treaſure: ſuch a Fool is every ſinner that wilfully diſpleaſeth God, to ſatisfie a vain and inordinate deſire: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what more common in the Scripture, than to find Folly put for Sin, and the Sinner for a Fool? It's needleſs to cite places in a Caſe ſo known and obvious: Now conſider, how oft haſt thou thus play'd the Fool? And is it not time to return to thy Wits again? How much hath ſin befooled their underſtandings, that refuſe a little pains, and ſelf-denial, to get the Everlaſting Crown and Kingdom? Much more that take ſo much pains to get into the place of Torment and Miſery, as ſome will undergo? Will not the Toyl that ſome Worldlings will diſpenſe with, to get a little Worldly Treaſure, convince the one of Folly? And the ſhifts that Men will uſe to eſcape a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Miſery, riſe up and condemn the other of ſtark Madneſs? We ſee Men rip up the Bowels of the Earth, and dig into the Entrails of craggy Rocks, and take incredible pains, to get a little
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:134641:227"/>Silver, and Gold: They will break their ſweeteſt ſleep, to accompliſh an ambitious deſire; They will ſpend their Patrimony, their Credit, their Bodies, and their very Souls, for a drop of Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Pleaſure, and Carnal Delight. What's the matter, that we cannot be content to ſpend a few earneſt Thoughts, to uſe a little ſerious Diligence, for the purchaſe of ſo great a Glory as Chriſt doth promiſe to his Servants, for the Riches of Heaven, For the Promiſes of this Life, and that which is to come, for a Dignity not inferiour to Angels; for a Sea of Delights and Pleaſures, that raviſh the Heart of God himſelf? Alas! we are ſurely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Pleaſures which our Lord calleth us to, or elſe we are Fools indeed to ſtop our Ears: Our carnal beſotted Hearts imagine that there is nothing better, than to eat and to drink, and to ſatiate the Body with that which tickleth the Senſes: Certainly if Men did believe, that the Joyes of Heaven, are as far beyond all the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Life, as Heaven is beyond Earth, they could not, they would not forſake the Service of Chriſt, for ſome little diſcouragements as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they muſt meet with: Let ſuch faint-hearted Cowards as theſe, remember what Sufferings Chriſt himſelf underwent, and Contradiction of Sinners he endured, that they may not be weary, and faint in their minds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3. And let me ſay to ſuch, as Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, in another Caſe, to his yet ignorant Diſciples, <hi>O Fools and ſlow of Heart to (underſtand) and believe, ought not you (chearfully) to ſuffer theſe things, and to enter into glory,</hi> Luke 24.24, 25. And for the other ſort, that take ſo much pains to undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:134641:228"/>Let me but appeal to their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ask them, whether it is not palpable Folly to refuſe to do that; for to make themſelves everlaſtingly happy, which they will not refuſe to do, to make themſelves eternally miſerable? <hi>Ob.</hi> But they will ſay, They intend it not; They think to make themſelves happy, by ſuch Toil and Pains. <hi>An.</hi> You much mend the matter, by this Objection, and wipe off the Aſperſion: For if thou art not a Fool the one way, thou art another; Canſt thou imagine, (unleſs thou wert guilty of this Accuſation) that to riſe up early, and ſit up late, and eat the Bread of Carefulneſs, to get a little more of the World, and the Pleaſures of the Fleſh, (when God's Service is neglected) is the way to make thy ſelf happy? Thou couldſt not think thus, if thou wert not ignorant, and wholly bereft of thine underſtanding: Conſider therefore before it be too late, what Folly thou haſt been guilty of, in forſaking God, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ways of thine own Heart; And humble thy ſelf at laſt, and pour forth thy Tears before God, in the ſence of thy fooliſh, ſinful diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; And lift up thy broken Heart to him for Pardon in the Name of thy Redeemer: And this is the way to recover thy Wits again, and to come to thy ſelf, as the Prodigal did, when he returned to his Father, and confeſſed his ſin.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider, There is no ſpark of true Ingenuity left in that Heart, that refuſeth to lay to Heart the Tranſgreſſions he hath committed againſt God: Doth not thy Heart ſmite thee, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it a burthen to thy Soul, that thou haſt wearied him with thy rebellions, and made him to ſerve with thy ſins? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.24. Doth it ſeem a ſmall matter to thee, that thou haſt ſlighted his Word, neglected his Service, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned his Sabbaths, deſpiſed the offers of his Grace, taken part with his Enemies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred every fooliſh Delight, before his Love and and Favour? Be it known to thee, thou art of a baſe and ſordid diſpoſition, and utterly forſaken of all Reaſon and Ingenuity: God deals not with Men in a way of Violence and Conſtraint; He could eaſily force thee to an Acknowledgment of thy Pride, and Worldlineſs, and filthy Luſts, which thou doeſt ſo carefully conceal, and the hainous diſhonour thou haſt done to his Name; He could make thine own Conſcience fall upon thee and condemn thee, in deſpight of thee, and thy Tongue to fall upon thy ſelf: But he loves to deal with every Creature according to the Nature he hath given them: He leaves thee to thine own choice, having given thee Reaſon to diſcern what is fitteſt to be done, and his infallible Word, to guide thee: He uſeth Arguments to perſwade, rather than Power to compel, and draws thee with Cords of a Man, (as the Prophet expreſſeth it) <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.4. That if Love and Ingenuity will not prevail with thee, to do thy Duty to him, Shame and Ingenuity might perſwade thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee of the Folly: There is ſome ingenuity, in a free and open confeſſion of thy ſin, and a
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:134641:229"/>proportionable ſorrow for it, and endeavour to vindicate the Name of God, which thou haſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, after thou haſt been ſo diſingenious to diſhonour him by thy Tranſgreſſions: He that can harden himſelf againſt his deareſt Friend, and blot his precious Name with any foul Aſperſions, and then juſtifie and defend what he hath done, or at leaſt manifeſt himſelf to be altogether inſenſible of ſuch behaviour, deſerves to be thruſt out of the Society of Men; And all Men would take him for a Monſter, and degenerate piece of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: But it's a thouſand times worſe to play ſuch Tricks with God, who will lay them to Heart, and not let them go unpuniſhed: And when he ſees thou art paſt all Ingenuity, and haſt out grown the Heart of a Man, and there is nothing to be done with thee, without ſtripes and blows, he will deal with thee, as Maſters uſe to deal with a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that will no longer be moved by any other Arguments, make them the common whipping-Blocks of the School, that by their juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other that have ſome ingenuity ſtill left, may take warning: or elſe turn ſuch untractable Diſciples quite out of their Tuition: O, my Brethren, your Caſe would be ſad indeed, if it ſhould once come to any of theſe: The <hi>Heathen</hi> could ſay,

Surely you cannot reflect upon thoſe rebellious, ſinful Courſes you have taken, and not be moved with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt your corrupt Inclinations, that have ſo much ſeduced you: Surely you can never be vile enough in your own Eyes, that have ſo much vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and deſpiſed the juſt Commands of him that holdeth your Soul in life, and keepeth you every moment: If you are paſt all ſorrow for ſin, you are paſt all hope, and are become like a broken Veſſel, that can never be made up again: <hi>Peter</hi> indeed was ſo diſingenious, to deny his deareſt Maſter, the effect of whoſe ſweeteſt Love he had ſo often taſted: But it was when he was in a fright and paſſion: He no ſooner thought upon his odious diſingenuity, but the poor Man melts into Tears, and weeps bitterly: There's no ſin but is curable, but this of Final Impenitance and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider, there's no Evil or Miſery whatſoever calls for Grief and Sorrow ſo much as Sin doth: And yet we can weep our Eyes out, almoſt, for ſome petty Evils and Miſeries that ſometimes do afflict us: What an abſurd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous ſorrow is it to cry for the death of a Friend, to howl for the loſs of a Child, and to be overwhelmed with grief, when an intimate, dear Acquaintance is ſnatch'd away from thee? And yet to be heart-whole, when God is provoked to depart from thee, and thou art in danger to loſe thy Soul: We take the Perſon for a Child or a Fool, that whines and makes a ſtir for a Trifle, and makes ſad Complaints for a Scratch, or a Flea-bite, and is little or no whit moved for the loſs of his Credit or good Name, or ſomething that's far better; This, as well as all other Paſſions in Man, ſhould be governed by Reaſon, otherwiſe they are no more regardable than the howling of a Dog; And how is that Paſſion guided by Reaſon, that makes a great Noiſe, and is moved with much Violence for a Matter of nothing; and is very quiet when it hath much more cauſe to be moved: Is that a rational ſorrow, or doth become a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that hath underſtanding, that brings a Man down even to death's door, for the departure of ſome worldly comfort, and leaves him without Tears and Sighs, when he is loſing that which is a thouſand times more deſirable? Underſtand thy ſelf aright, and thou wilt be aſhamed of ſuch a ridiculous ſorrow as this: Sin is the cauſe of all other Evil that comes upon thee, and therefore muſt needs be far worſe it ſelf, and much more to be lamented; It takes away thy Friend from thy
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:134641:230"/>ſide, thy Child from thy boſom; It bereaves thee of thy Health, deprives thee of thy Credit and Eſtate; It parts between thy Soul and Body, and makes the moſt lamentable divorce of all between God and thy Soul: <hi>As I live (ſaith the Lord) though the Son of</hi> Jehoiakim, <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>were the Signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck him thence,</hi> Jerem. 22.24. And why is this, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had provoked God by his ſin: It is ſin that is our greateſt Enemy: It's our Comfort againſt all other Enemies, that they can purſue us no further than the Grave, <hi>and there the weary be at reſt,</hi> Job 3.17. There we ſhall feel our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubles no longer; But this Enemy begins then to rage moſt, when all other Cruelties ceaſe: Then it comes upon us like a Tempeſt; It follows us beyond the Grave, and will never leave us, till it hath compleated our Miſery, and put us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all hope: And ſhall this trouble us no more? Well might our Saviour bid the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not to weep for him, but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and for their ſins, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.28. They had ſome womaniſh Tears to command, when they ſaw him led away to Execution, but might have ſhed them far more acceptably for their ſins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had brought ſuch a horrid thing to paſs: It's a lamentable ſight, to ſee Men endued with reaſon, to ring their hands, and weep, for almoſt nothing, and to be cruelly hard-hearted when they have the greateſt cauſe to weep: What a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there, between a little bodily ſuffering, and the intolerable pains of thy Soul? between a little Scratch in thy Fleſh, and the Wounds of thy Spirit? <hi>A wounded Spirit, who can bear?</hi> ſaith

                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider, This is one great End for which Chriſt ſhed his Blood, and ſuffered the ſhameful Death upon the Croſs, that he might bring Sinners to Repentance; He knew they could never be happy, till they ſhould get a true ſight of the Sin and Miſery, and till their Hearts were throughly broken for their Tranſgreſsions; And that they muſt part with their Corruptions, or part with God: Being therefore moved with wonderful pity and compaſsion towards them, and loth that they ſhould go on and periſh in their Rebellion againſt God, hath undertook to bring them to Repentance: If the work could have been done by him alone, it would have been a matter of far leſs difficulty to effect and bring to paſs; But he well knew, before he began to make the leaſt attempt, that it was a far eaſier task to ſhed his blood, and ſatisfie for his ſins paſs'd, than to bring us to future obedience: If it had been only to lay down his Life for us, ſo great was his compaſsion to us, that he could eaſily have parted with it; But this was not all, no, nor the one half; He had a worſe work to do, the ſtubborn, rebellious Heart of Man, to change and to renew; He muſt be brought to ſee and confeſs and renounce his ſins, and come again and ſubmit himſelf to his Maker, whom he had provoked, or elſe his Blood would be ſpilt in vain: O my Brethren, this was a work indeed, and ſets forth the wonderful amazing Love of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that he would undertake ſuch a Task as this!

How he trod the Wine-preſs of his Father's wrath, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3. and drunk off the dregs of the bitter cup of his diſpleaſure, and ſwet drops of Blood, while he was conflicting with the Terrours of God's wrath; And is not that Man a block in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that cannot be moved with ſuch Rhetorick as this is? Is that Man fit to be pardoned, or to find any Mercy at God's hands, that ſtoppeth his Ears to one that hath thus befriended him, when he is pleading with him, to make his Heart give and relent for all his former ſins? It's certain, that Mans caſe is deſperate, that will not yield to ſuch an Argument as this is. But, alas! ſad and woful experience tells us how many Thouſand ſlight it, and are no more moved with the real ſtory of Chriſt's Paſſion, than with a Romance or Fable, no, nor many, I fear, half ſo much. O how muſt this needs Crucifie our Lord afreſh, to ſee his love and tender compaſſion ſo much ſlighted, and his Blood trampled under feet! O wretched unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſinner! Canſt thou find in thy heart, to run the bloody Spear, and to ſtrike the Nails afreſh into his Side and Hands, and to perſecute him whom God hath wounded, yea, and that for thy ſin? Haſt thou the Heart of a Man, or fierce Savage Beaſt, that canſt add Sorrow to ſuch Afflictions? Is it Nothing to thee, that he was ſuch a Man of Sorrows, and ſo deſpiſed of Men, and ſmitten
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:134641:233"/>of God? What? when thou thy ſelf art the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for which he hath borne all this? Is it no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thee, though he was led as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a Sheep, dumb before the ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. Wo to thee, that ever God made thee a Man, if thou art become ſuch a hard-hearted Rock: He ſubmitted to all this, that he might prevail with God, on the one ſide, to be reconciled unto ſinners, and that he might prevail with ſinners, on the other ſide, to repent, and be reconciled unto God: The former part of his Work he hath already done, He hath gained his Father's Conſent; And wilt not thou Conſent to lay by thine Enmity to God; to confeſs thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins, and to return to thy Obedience? It ſhall be more tolerable, ſurely, for the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that never had ſuch Mercy offered them, in the Day of Judgment, than for ſuch hard-hearted, impenitent ſinners: But this is not all that Chriſt does for them, he bears with them in wonderful patience; ſometimes he caſts a gracious Look upon them, as once he did upon <hi>Peter,</hi> as if he would melt them in deſpight of all their obſtinacy; And ſeems to ſay to them, What, ſinner, ſhall I ſuffer, and wilt thou ſuffer too, rather than repent and live? Shall I bleed to the very death, to ſave thee from deſtruction, and wilt thou have no Mercy upon thy ſelf? Turn thee, Turn thee; Why wilt thou dye, O impenitent ſinner? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he frowns upon the ſinner, and threatens him with a ſorer and heavier Condemnation, if he will not repent, and all that he might gain his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; He aſſaults him on all ſides, that he might recover him by Repentance unto that happy ſtate,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:134641:233"/>which he doth ſo much deſire to ſee him poſſeſſed of: He ſets the Motives of Eternal Life and Death before him, and gives him many a precious Hour to ponder and conſider them: He ſends his Spirit alſo to knock at the door of his Heart, that he may be let in: Wo a thouſand Times to that Man that will not be invited to Repentance, by all theſe Means: Good it had been for that Man or Woman, if they had never been born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is the End of all the Ordinances of God, and every Providence, to work this Godly Sorrow in our Minds and Hearts, and bring us to Repentance: It is the Firſt intention of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word, to kill ſin in us by Repentance, and then to bring us on to the Life of Faith and Holineſs: And all the Doctrines that are taught and delivered to us in the Miniſtry of the Word, are to drive on this Deſign: The Doctrine of God's Attributes and Perfections, is but the better to inform us of our Duty, and what Service is due to ſuch a Majeſty ſo related to us, and to qualifie and prepare our Hearts to a reverend and humble Performance of our Duty; And to ſhew us what a ſin it is either to neglect it, or ſlight it over: And conſequently to bring us to judge, abhor, and condemn our ſelves, when we have any of this Guilt upon us: All the Doctrines that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves, and that teach us what we were by Nature, and what we are by Practice, and what we may be through the Grace of God and the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, ſerve effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to ſhame and humble us, and to break our very Hearts in the ſenſe of that Miſery that ſin hath brought upon us: If God made us ſuch
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:134641:234"/>beautiful, lovely Creatures, and we have made our ſelves ſuch deformed, loathſome ſinners, doth it not become our Duty, and highly beſeem us, to afflict our ſouls with the bitter remembrance thereof, eſpecially when God offereth Mercy to ſuch penitent afflicted ſinners? All the Doctrines that concern our Brethren, what do they ſerve for, but to teach us the Extent of our Duty to them, and the hainouſneſs of our ſin, that have ſo much failed in all the reſpects that we owe to God and Men; That ſo the more diſtinct ſight and knowledge of our ſin, may make our Repentance more ſound and compleat. To what end are all the Terrible Threatnings of God's Word againſt Sin and Sinners, but either to prevent the Sin, or elſe to humble the Sinner, after he is fallen under the Threatning; and to work upon the Paſſion of Fear, that by it the ſinner may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened to conſider what he hath done. And whither to ſerve all the Promiſes, but to perfect that work more kindly which the Fear of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath begun? There's not a Doctrine that's Preached and Publiſhed to us by the Miniſtry of the Word, but what comes on this very Errand, and hath a ſubſerviency to this End, and ſhould be effectually managed to ſuch a purpoſe, by all that are intruſted with this Sacred Office.</p>

                  <p>THere's nothing that more becomes a Believer, nor ſo well ſuits his Spiritual, Heavenly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor is a better Indication of a Child of God, and one that hath attained to a perfect Man, to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, than to delight and be skilful in this Noble Work: And without all diſpute, There's nothing that a corrupt Heart is more averſe and backward to, and hath leſs skill in: There is indeed a joyful, merry Heart, pre-requiſite to this Exerciſe, but ſuch a one as the World intermedleth not with; but is the greateſt ſtranger to, of all things you can imagine: Though there's none love Mirth and Joy ſo paſſionately, as the worldling, yet his Mirth is quite of another ſtamp: It's the meer diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Countenance, or at beſt, but the dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Blood and Spirits; It is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation and contentment of the Mind and Spirit: It's the laughter of a Fool, a meer brutiſh, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual delight, that they are ſo fond of: Not the ſolid, ſerious pleaſure of a Saint, and one that is perfectly in his right mind: And thus to be merry after their Faſhion, is no hard nor difficult Task; 'Tis but be Mad, and let go the Reigns of all good Government of a Mans ſelf; It is but to gratifie every deſire, and live at Randome, and proſper in Folly, and this will ſcrew up a Carnal Mind to very profuſe Laughter and Merriment: All the Town ſhall quickly hear of it, and perceive it too plainly in the Vanity, Pride, and Inſolency of their Carriage: And there's no ſurer way, to damp and dead the Spirit of theſe Men, and to drive them into a melancholy, dumpiſh vein, than to ſpring
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:134641:237"/>ſome Heavenly Diſcourſe, that ſavoureth of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom, and tendeth to the Divine Praiſes; It's eaſie to vent a little Froth and Mirth, at a Feaſt, or in a Jovial Meeting, or when the Spirits are cheared with Wine and Carnal Pleaſure: But to be glad in the Lord, to rejoyce in the meditation of his Excellent Greatneſs, and Perfection, even when the Flocks are cut off from the Fold, and there is no Herd in the Stall, and the Vine yieldeth not her Encreaſe, and the labour of the Olive doth fail, and all Earthly Comforts are wanting; Then to rejoyce in the moſt High, and to vent forth freely in Thanks and Praiſes unto him, is the Top and Perfection of Piety: But this is a ſtrain that the merrieſt Worldling can never reach, while he continues to be ſuch: Other Mirth needs great Reſtraint, but this hath need of all Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Promotion, it being ſo much above the Sphaere of corrupted Nature to do it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And as ſome ſlight Praiſe (I doubt not) may come from the Mouth of one not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt by a lively Faith, from the ſenſe of Common Mercies, and General Grace: So (on the other ſide) even a Believer, through the weakneſs of his Grace, and the diſtemper of his Body, and the want of Exerciſe in this Duty, may make but little Muſick, and be a very Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in this Work; And ſo loſe the Comfort and Strength that a Heart, fervent and frequent in this Duty would daily get.</p>
                  <p>But before I ſay any thing to ſtir up to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, I will firſt ſhew what's requiſite to, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this Joy and Delight in God, and true Gratitude and Praiſe, I put them all together,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:134641:237"/>becauſe there is much Affinity and Correſpondence between them: And therefore</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the Subject</hi> of theſe Acts, or the Perſon that muſt exert them, he muſt be thus qualified and prepared:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He muſt be of an open, cheerful Temper: There's none more unfit for this Duty, than the lumpiſh, ſad and heavy Heart: Though I deny not but ſadneſs and heavineſs of Spirit is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Duty, after the Commiſſion of ſin (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially great and wilful ſin) till by renewed Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Confeſſion, and a more cautelous Heed to prevent it for the future, and the application of Chriſt's Blood by Faith, the Cauſe of ſuch Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be removed; But a conſtant, habitual ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſpondency, that neither Faith nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can eaſily ſtir or command, is a great Enemy to this Duty; He therefore that would be always fit for this Duty, muſt with all his Might reſiſt the true and principal Cauſe of Sadneſs (I mean Sin) and when he cannot prevent it, he muſt ſpeedily repent of it, and turn from it, and renew his Faith in Chriſt, and then his Soul will not refuſe to be comforted, but will chear up, and at length attain ſuch a good meaſure of Alacrity, as will become Chriſtianity, and conſtantly diſpoſe him to this Duty, provided his Body be not oppreſſed with melancholy Fumes and Vapours: For in ſuch Caſe the Art of the Phyſician muſt be joyned with the fore-mentioned Preſcriptions: And ſuch Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Exerciſe of the Body muſt be uſed as may reduce it again, and make it fit to ſubſerve a chearful Mind: There's no greater pull-back, nor obſtruction, to this becoming, generous, heavenly
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:134641:238"/>Work, than a ſower, dejected, and contracted Spirit: The <hi>Jews</hi> had a Proverb amongſt them, that <hi>Spiritus ſanctus non deſcendit ſuper Animum maeſtum:</hi> which though taken without limitation, is not true; becauſe the Spirit of God, works Godly Sorrow, and dwells in the contrite Heart that's broken for ſin, to revive, comfort and bind it up again; yet, with ſome reſtriction, it contains a very great Truth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Divine Spirit in it more Noble and Excellent Operations of Love, Joy, and Delight, and thoſe other Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that have a very near confederacy with theſe and chearful Obedience, which reſults from theſe, doth not deſcend upon thoſe that are of a ſad and heavy Heart, whilſt ſuch: But they are firſt exhile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and cheared by the <hi>Heavenly Comforter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can get up to theſe higher Duties: And though <hi>Godly Sorrow for ſin,</hi> be conſiſtent enough with ſome <hi>Spiritual Joy,</hi> and Concomitant Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions before mentioned, whilſt it keeps its juſt degree and meaſure, yet when it proceeds to Heighth and Exceſs, and goes beyond its juſt Bounds, it greatly indiſpoſeth to Works of that Elevation: But the Sorrow of the World work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Death, and is therefore very inconſiſtent with Works that require the greateſt Life; yea, the ſorrow and dejectedneſs that ariſe from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Complexion of a Melancholick Body, do very much hinder the Soul in theſe more ſublime and raiſed Operations: And the more voluntary it is through the wilful neglect of Means, either Medicinal or Moral, whereby it may be ſhaken off, ſtill the greater Enemy it is to the joyful Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Work. When therefore we prepare for
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:134641:238"/>this Work, every weight muſt be caſt away, and the ſin that preſſeth down, and all indiſpoſing dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be ſhaken off, as much as may be. And therefore <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to make way for the Holy Spirit, in theſe noble Operations of it, calls for a Muſical Inſtrument, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.15. the better to compoſe and exhilerate his Mind: <hi>And it came to paſs, whilſt the Minſtrel played, that the Hand,</hi> (that is) <hi>the Spirit of the Lord came upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He muſt be of a competent Candour and Ingenuity towards Men; One that will readily do good, and as eaſily acknowledge it, when it is done by others; That affects not to conceal his own Infirmities, nor the Worth of others, but can quickly ſpy out both; That judgeth not according to outward Appearance, but judgeth righteous Judgment; And is prone to take every thing by the right handle, and to paſs the faireſt conſtruction upon every thing: He that's diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and baſe towards Men, will be ſo towards God: For it is in other Affections, as it is in Love: Now he that loveth his Brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen? Is the Argument of the beloved Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He muſt be very well contented with his Condition: None more Averſe to the Duty in hand, than he that's diſpleaſed with his Eſtate: How can that Man be thankful unto God for any thing he hath, that liketh nothing? Male-Content filleth a Man with rage and bitterneſs againſt every thing almoſt, as ſuppoſing it to contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his uneaſie Condition: It puts him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:134641:239"/>upon ſinful ſtudy and contrivance, to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf; And it is ſo far from diſpoſing any to the ſweet Temper, I am now ſpeaking of, that it prompts him to be angry with every one; Such a one taſts no ſweetneſs in any good he hath, be it never ſo great, and therefore forgets all, but his diſcontents: He pores wholly upon his Miſery, and nothing elſe ſeems worthy his obſervation: And that Man that hath no eye, to obſerve any Comfort that he hath, will never think himſelf obliged to him from whom they come; and ſuch a one is moſt unfit for a Thankful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He muſt have made ſome good progreſs in the work of Mortification, and be pretty well weaned from all Sublunary Good and Pleaſure: That hath no ſtrong propenſion to Senſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Carnal Delights, but hath got a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Conqueſt over the Fleſh, with its Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Luſts: And hath a Love that's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and doth propend moſt to that which moſt deſerves it: For how can he perform the higheſt Acts of Spiritual Life, that is not firſt dead to thoſe things, that do ſtifle and utterly quench the Spiritual Life? Or how can he thank God aright for any thing, that is not in a capacity to make a true judgment of what God doth beſtow? which is the Caſe of every one, that hath his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections inordinately wedded to theſe Earthly Contentments: Such a one cannot take a worldly Croſs, or Reproach, and Shame, and Sickneſs, and other Afflictions, to be ſuch Mercies as they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are, nor thank God ſometimes for them more heartily, than for any outward proſperity.</p>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:134641:239"/>
                  <p n="5">5. He muſt have a deep Senſe and Perſwaſion of the Certainty and Excellency of Eternal Things; The Immortality of the Soul; The worth of God's Favour; The unſpeakable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the damned; And the Felicity of thoſe that muſt live for ever with God: otherwiſe the Pleaſures of this World are but a Dream, and the Happineſs of this Life but a ſhadow, and all the Comforts that are tyed to this ſtate, ſo fickle and unſatisfactory, that a wiſe and conſiderate Man will not much regard them, [unleſs as they be Pledges and Fore-runners of a better Felicity] and ſo cannot riſe to any high pitch of Joy and Thankfulneſs, whilſt it hath no better Materials to erect ſuch a Frame, nor better Motives to this Duty.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the <hi>Matter,</hi> or what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite to make way for theſe High and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acts of Gratitude and Praiſe, [which are always accompanied with ſome degree of joy and delight in God] which formally and principally imply,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A due obſervation and worthy eſtimation of the Amiable Perfections of God, and of his Grace and Favours towards us; If we overlook theſe, and our Eyes be in the ends of the Earth, when they ſhould be intent upon the infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and his Mercies towards us every Hour, and his Right in us, and over us; we ſhall be either tempted to deny them, or at leaſt to deny that Homage which they call for: If we can overlook him that is all, in all, and the Spring that moves all ſecond Cauſes, and ſets them on work to do us that good which they do for us at any time;
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:134641:240"/>No wonder if we commit Sacriledge, and rob God of his deſerved Praiſes, yea, or if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value them and miſtake the Mercies that are more worth than Heaven and Earth, to be but petty and inconſiderable, we ſhall be as ſlight in our grateful Acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two or three Things therefore are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in the due Reverence and Eſtimation of God, and his Favours.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. A clear and ſolid Apprehenſion of our own great Unworthineſs of any the leaſt of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and our infinite diſtance from his Perſon, not only by Nature, but much more through Guilt and Sin: we muſt be pretty well acquainted with our own Poverty and Baſeneſs, and that we have nothing but from him; That All is forfeited again and again; That the Miſeries of this Life, and that which is to come, are our Deſert; That God can expect no Advantage from us, when he beſtows his Mercies, but the pleaſure of doing good; Nor when we are moſt cordial and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his Service, but the pleaſure of our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Good, and ſeeing his Grace proſper in us: And that in all his Threats and Puniſhments, he is ſtill deſigning our Good, and mortifying our Corruption, which will otherwiſe be ſure to ruine and undo us, if it be not forſaken: And this would teach us to prize, and thank God and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, for every piece of Bread that we eat; and the Houſe that covers us, and the Cloaths that warm us, the Sun that ſhineth on us, the Rod that corrects us, when we come to know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much we need them, and how little we deſerve them.</p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:134641:240"/>
                  <p n="2">2ly. It would help us to prize all the Mercies of God, if we did but conſider and underſtand the Miſery of thoſe that want them: We could not want the Bread we eat, nor the Air we breath, nor the Limbs we uſe, nor the Senſes that we have, without Miſery enough; But what Man could want the Grace of the Goſpel, the Merits and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt, that knows that he is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly undone without them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. It will help us to eſtimate them rightly, if we conſider what they coſt, and the price that paid for them: Our ſins, and the ſins of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (whoſe Fleſh and Blood we are) did cry out aloud for vengeance, in the utter deſtruction of our Perſons; And God, who is the juſt and righteous Governour of the World, could not, without diſparagement to his Wiſdom and Juſtice, ſtop his Ears to the Cry of our Sins, unleſs his Son had ſuffered for our Sins, and ſatisfied the Demands of his Juſtice, and purchaſed all our forfeited Mercies back again by his Blood: So that all the Temporal and Spiritual Mercies that now we have were Redeemed not with Silver and Gold, but by the precious Blood of our moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared Saviour. And this Conſideration, if it be not cuſtomary, but ſerious, will make every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy full weight, and enforce better Apprehenſions of them, and Thankfulneſs for them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly <hi>and laſtly,</hi> It will conduce very much to the worthy Eſtimation of all God's Mercies, if we conſider the End God hath in All; to which he doth deſign every Mercy that he doth beſtow in this preſent Life: And that is our higheſt Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and everlaſting Felicity, in a bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:134641:241"/>with God for ever: Every Hour he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us, Every Favour, whether Common, or Special, is valued infinitely below its worth, if this Reference and Subordination be overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He can never thank God, as he ought, for his Health, or Food, or Friends, or any Temporal Mercy or Affliction, but will rather be tempted to murmur and repine ſometimes, that conſiders not well, what it is intended for, and what it may and ſhould contribute to his endleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Reſt: Theſe Particulars muſt concur, to make up a due Eſtimation of all God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Gratitude and Praiſe, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant Affections of Joy and Delight in God, do eſſentially imply,</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. A Love that's ſuited to and bears ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the Mercies we receive, and God doth beſtow on us: Temporal and Tranſitory Mercies muſt be loved with a lower and ſubordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our Love: Spiritual and Eternal Mercies muſt be loved with a higher and more abſolute degree of our Love: And the higheſt Mercy of all (which is himſelf) with the moſt ſuperlative and tranſcendent Love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. And they do imply a greater Love to his Perſon: 1. That hath purchaſed them: 2. That doth confer them: He that hath no Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the Things which he doth receive, and that according to the greater or leſſer Tendency they have to lead him to the higheſt Mercy, even the Fruition of God the Giver, will have none (worth the naming) in the perſon that doth beſtow them; And he that wants that, can
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:134641:241"/>never praiſe God as he ought, nor do any ſuch Act with acceptance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There muſt be ſome ſenſible Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this Eſtimation of the Mind, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of the Will in God and his Mercies; In the Affections and Senſible Paſſions of Love, Joy, Admiration, Reverence, Humility, which help and aſſiſt the Will, and cannot lye ſtill, when the Soul is well elevated in Praiſes and Thankſgiving: when the Soul is exerciſed with any ſeriouſneſs and vigour in theſe noble Operations of Praiſe, and Thanks and Complacency in God, how can it chuſe but work upon the Blood and Spirits, and cauſe thoſe forementioned Paſſions in ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible degree?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And as Thankfulneſs and Holy Praiſe, if they be right, will become <hi>ſenſible,</hi> by the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the very Body to which the Soul is linked, [more or leſs, according as the Grace that cauſeth them is more or leſs vigorous] ſo they will become <hi>viſible</hi> to others, by our more ready obſervance of his Will and Pleaſure, a greater Zeal for his Intereſt, and Glory in the World, and a more chearful obedience to him, whom we thus praiſe and admire: And as in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> there were three kinds of Sacrifice, <hi>Immolations, Libations,</hi> and <hi>Victimes: Immolations</hi> were made of the Fruits of the Earth; <hi>Libations</hi> of Liquors, as Oyls and Wines; <hi>Victimes</hi> of living Creatures: So the Soul that is truly Grateful, will not only offer up himſelf to God for a Victime; and his Affections as it were for Liquors; but his Actions alſo for Fruits.</p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:134641:242"/>
                  <p>Thanks among Men ſignifie nothing, that eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and melt away into meer Words and Air, and do not proceed to ſubſtantial Acts and Deeds: Theſe are the Complements and Perfection of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Moral Act: And if they come not up to Life and Practice, where there is opportunity, they are but meer Mockery and Deceit.</p>
                  <p>Having ſomewhat explicated the Nature of Theſe Affections which are to be exerciſed, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Conſiderations, which if ſeriouſly thought upon, have Force enough to provoke and quicken to this Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Affections will ſtir and get ſtrength, if thine Eye be much upon God, and all other Objects, as much as may be, be thruſt out of thy Mind, I mean his Attributes, as they are expreſſed in his Word: For, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his Works, they will be ſome farther Aſſiſtance to this Work: His unchangeable Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being: His unſearchable Wiſdom: His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Power, that can do any thing that implies not a Contradiction: His unexpreſſible Goodneſs: His ſpotleſs Purity, that abhors all unrighteouſneſs and injuſtice; And the reſt of his moſt Adorable Perfections well thought upon [according to that Deſcription which the Holy Ghoſt giveth of them in the Scriptures] will raiſe a Soul to ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pitch, that it ſhall find no eaſe or pleaſure, but in the High Praiſes of his Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſty and Greatneſs: If the Heart be thus exerciſed, the Tongue that's moſt dumb, will be looſed, and even forced to cry out, <hi>Thou only, O Lord, art worthy to be Adored:</hi> For thine is the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:134641:242"/>Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory: A little Glimpſe of this Majeſty made <hi>David,</hi> though a Potent King, to cry out, <hi>What is Man, that thou art mindful of him, or the Son of Man, that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> Pſalm 8.4. This made <hi>Job,</hi> who had inſiſted ſo much before upon his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and had ſtood ſo much upon his own Defence and Juſtification, then to abhor himſelf, when <hi>Elihu</hi> had preſented him with ſome little Deſcription of the Almighty and Independent Being. To gaze a little upon the Majeſty of a King, and that Power of theirs, whereby they can do almoſt what they pleaſe within the Limits of their Dominions, makes ſome Men almoſt to fall down and worſhip them; and give them the Honour that's due only to God: And they think <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Argument warrant enough to ſuch Adoration; <hi>Where the Word of a King is, there is Power; and who may ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> Eccleſ. 8.4. The Parts and excellent Abilities of ſome wiſe and knowing Men, procures them a very great Intereſt in the Affections and Eſteem of others: How much more ſhould it make us to wonder, and fall down, and be even ſwallowed up with Admiration, did we but look up, and caſt our Eye upon the Beauty, Wiſdom and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of him that made all things, and gave the things that are moſt glorious among Men, that Luſtre that maketh them ſo much to dazle their weak Eyes.</p>
                  <p>Take therefore, O my Soul! ſome ſhort Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the All-Glorious God, out of his own inſpired Word; which upon that Account, thou mayeſt give the more heed and credit to.</p>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:134641:243"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> 11.7, 8, 9. Canſt thou by ſearching, find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty to Perfection? It is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly, The Crown of all his Attributes</hi> is his Eternity. Of theſe in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>His Bounty</hi> the Scripture thus expreſſeth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.15. <hi>Thou openeſt thy hand, and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> Matth. 6.28, 29. <hi>Conſider the Lilies of the field, they toil not, neither do they ſpin, and yet I ſay anto you, that even</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.27, 28. <hi>Theſe wait all upon thee,</hi> [ſpeaking of the ſeveral living Creatures] <hi>that thou mayeſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon: Thou openeſt thy hand, and they are filled with good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>His Juſtice</hi> in the Righteous Government of all things, the Holy Ghoſt thus ſets forth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.14. <hi>Juſtice and Judgment are the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thy Throne.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.8. <hi>He ſhall judge the World in Righteouſneſs, and miniſter Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the World in uprightneſs.</hi> Jerem. 32.19. <hi>Thine Eyes are upon all the Ways of the Sons of Men, to give to every one according to his Ways, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>His Veracity</hi> is thus deſcribed:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>His Mercy and Compaſſion</hi> to all Rational Creatures is thus expreſſed: <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Ezek. 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in him that dyeth, or in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, For why will ye dye?</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. There it's ſaid, that God would have all to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to come to the knowledge of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Beſides,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All thoſe Scriptures that expreſs the Death of Chriſt for ſinners, without limitation, ſerve to this purpoſe, ſuch as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Who gave himſelf a Ranſome for all Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:134641:245"/>
                  <p n="2">2. All thoſe Scriptures that contain a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Preach the Goſpel to all the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exception, magnifie this Attribute to the full, and make it ſhine forth gloriouſly; ſuch as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Likewiſe all thoſe Scriptures that promiſe Pardon and Salvation, upon the Conditions of Repentance and Faith, not excluding any from theſe Terms, are a lively demonſtration of this lovely Attribute; ſuch as 1 <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. So likewiſe all thoſe Scriptures that ſet forth the Patience of God towards ſinners in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, may be reduced hither, and ſerve under this Head.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, All thoſe Scriptures that inſiſt upon the Common Providences of God towards wicked Men, and his verieſt Enemies, in ſupplying all their Neceſſities, and giving them ſuch a large portion of theſe outward Comforts, bear ample Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to this Attribute, and do very much exalt it: ſuch as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. where God is ſaid to make the Sun to ſhine upon the Evil and upon the Good, and to ſend Rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>His Special Love to Believers,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt thus deſcribeth:</p>
                  <p>Deut. 33.29. <hi>The Lord is the ſhield of their help, and the ſword of their excellency.</hi> Pſal. 94.14. <hi>God will not caſt off his Saints, nor forſake his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.4. <hi>The Lord taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                  <p n="1">1. All thoſe Scriptures that entitle them to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Reconciliation, Adoption, and Glory, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in all Conditions, and a bleſſed Iſſue out of all their Troubles, be they more or leſs, and that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail a Bleſſing upon their Seed and Poſterity, are a ſufficient proof of God's ſpecial Love to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſet it forth illuſtriouſly; ſuch as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart.</hi> Pſal. 37.37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> Eccleſ. 8.12, 13. <hi>Though a ſinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, yet ſurely I know, that it ſhall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.28. <hi>The children of thy ſervants ſhall continue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before thee.</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, that walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> Pſal. 125.1, 2. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever: As the mountains are round about</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſo the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth, and for ever.</hi> Rom. 8.28. <hi>All things work together for their good.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe they are ſons, God will ſend forth the Spirit of his Son into their hearts.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. All thoſe Scriptures that contain their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial relations unto God, and Priviledges founded thereupon, do lively ſet forth God's ſpecial Love to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly, His Almightineſs</hi> the Scripture thus expreſſeth; beſides the places where he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſtyled Almighty: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20. <hi>He is able to do abundantly above what we can think or ſpeak.</hi> Job 26.14. <hi>The thunder of his power who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand?</hi> Prov. 21.30. <hi>There is no wiſdom, power, nor underſtanding againſt him.</hi> Jerem. 27.5. <hi>He hath made the Earth, and all that therein is, by his great power.</hi> Iſa. 40.22, 23. <hi>It is he that ſitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as Graſs-hoppers; that ſtretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and ſpreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: That bringeth the Princes to nothing, and maketh the Judges of the Earth as vanity.</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>God is there ſaid to uphold all things by the word of his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All thoſe Scriptures that aſſert the Creation of the World, or any part of it by God; The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Sea, or other Waters miraculouſly: The ſtrange Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha:</hi> The Inundation of the Old World: The Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Languages: The doing things againſt the Courſe of Nature; ſuch as are Raiſing the Dead to Life, Reſtoring the Blind: Or above Nature, ſuch as are moſt of the Plagues that befel <hi>Aegypt,</hi> amply deſcribe his Infinite Power: And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>His Immenſity</hi> is thus ſet forth by the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27. <hi>But will God indeed dwell on the Earth?

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:134641:249"/>and thankful Inclinations towards him in the Heart: There's not a Pile of Graſs that ſhoots up, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the Eye Heavenward, [towards which it pointeth up] unleſs it be kept ſhut by ignorance and inconſideration.

Even a Toad hath far more in it to be admired by the Intellect, than it hath to be abhorred by the Senſe. The ſenſleſs and inanimate Creatures are no idle Parts of the World, but have enough in them to reproach and ſhame an idle Spectatour: There's not one of them but wears the <hi>Livery</hi> of their moſt wiſe and wonderful Creatour; and carries the <hi>Badge</hi> and <hi>Cognizance</hi> of that infinite Wiſdom that did at firſt contrive and make them, and fitted them to their proper and peculiar uſes.

Can we be content to behold ſuch rare pieces of Divine Skill and Artifice, and not turn up a thankful Eye, nor erect an adoring Thought, nor ſend up a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hallelujah to him?

The Matter of which they do conſiſt. 2. The curious Contexture of their Parts. 3. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Production. And then 4. The Means of their Continuance and Preſervation.

Or to caſt an eye upon any one Creature, that dwelleth in any of theſe Manſions, will draw forth a Song of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, unleſs it be from one that's far gone in the Diſeaſe of Atheiſm and Ungodlineſs: But to conſider them all in one united Frame, their Order and Connection, and the Beauty that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from that Order, and how they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one <hi>Common Center,</hi> and are linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in one great and ultimate End,</hi> which all of them conſpire to promote [though their proximate and neareſt Ends are ſo various and almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable] will raiſe a Soul, not baſely captivated to the Body, yet higher. If I ſhould inſiſt upon the Contrariety that is among the ſeveral Creatures, and how one Contrary is ballanced by another: If I ſhould ſtand upon the Harmony that ariſeth from the very diſcord of things, of a very different nature, this would not a little ſet forth the wiſdom of God.</p>

Yea, and how bountiful hath he been to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Part of the Creation? What a fertile Womb hath he beſtowed upon the Earth, which brings forth yearly ſuch a plentiful Off-ſpring and Encreaſe? What Minerals and Vegetables is ſhe the Parent of? Some whereof ſhe perpetually bears in her Womb, and there feedeth them: Others ſhe continually carries in her Boſom, and there ſuckles them: And what ſhe doth not bring forth, ſhe bringeth up, (as the ſeveral Animals, <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Irrational</hi>) which ſhe perpetually provideth for: And as he hath dealt thus bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> ſo the Ocean comes not much behind in the ſhare he hath beſtowed upon it: And therefore when the <hi>Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt</hi> had copiouſly inſiſted upon God's Bounty and

                  <p n="3">3. The omnipotency and infinite power of God is no leſs conſpicuous in theſe ſeveral Creatures, than the other two Attributes of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, to a ſeeing eye, and as fit to aſſiſt in the Praiſes of God, as the other: Power is the thing that all Men adore, and aſpire to, and would purchaſe at any rate: Even thoſe that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn Riches, and Senſual Pleaſures, which moſt Men follow after, and are led by like Beaſts, yet are very ambitious of Power; As being the beſt Inſtrument to compaſs any thing that the Will can deſire: Well then, here is Power to be ſeen in its higheſt glory, and its utmoſt perfection: Alas! that Idol we ſo much adore in Men, is but a ſhadow and faint reſemblance of that infinite and unlimitted power, that God was eternally inveſted with, that's guided by as immenſe a Wiſdom, and as perfect a Goodneſs, and therefore cannot poſſibly be miſchievous and oppreſſive: Power in Man and other Creatures is oft times pernicious, both to themſelves and others, for want of equal Wiſdom and Goodneſs to guide and ballance it: And yet take all their Power together, in the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and wildeſt Notion, the greateſt Lord and Emperour of the World, hath but a ſilly, weak, and contemptible power, in reſpect of that which God is poſſeſſed of, and the Attribute of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs doth import, and which he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the eye ſight of all intelligent Creatures: And this may be ſeen without any great pains or
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:134641:252"/>labour, in the Make or Fabrick of every Creature, and the production of ſo many Beings, as the World abounds with, out of meer nothing: Let <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and the <hi>Roſe-Crucians</hi> boaſt, that they can produce Man, or any other Creature, by their Chymical Skill and Artifice; Theſe are but Boaſts, and if they can do any thing that way, which will deſerve ſome admiration; It will come as far ſhort of God's Workmanſhip, as Art is from Nature, or rather finite from infinite: They muſt have Matter to work upon, and ſeveral Tools to work with: But the infinite Power hath brought to paſs theſe mighty and wonderful Effects, that are every where ſo viſible, without the help of either Matter or Tool, or any the leaſt Aſſiſtance: O what a Power is that muſt make an inviſible Vapour, that fumes out of the Earth, to grow into the viſible Bulk of Plant or Herb! and to aſpire into a Tree, ſpreading forth it ſelf into ſo many Shoots and Branches! And that the ſame Vapour ſhould ſecretly convey it ſelf, through every Bough and Leaf of this Tree, for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Growth and Nouriſhment! That this ſubtil Spirit ſhould produce ſo many various Shapes, and ſuch different Vertues in the ſeveral Plants! and die them with ſuch various and almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Colours! That a Vapour that ſeems ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, ſhould ſet forth the Lilly in white, and cloth the Violet in ſuch a purple dreſs! But what do I ſpeak of theſe? What a Power is that, that hath hung ſuch a vaſt Body, as the Earth, upon nothing, in the midſt of the Air! That hath made it ſo immovable, though it hath no Pillars to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, nor any <hi>Baſis</hi> whereon to reſt! That hath
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:134641:253"/>ſhut up the vaſt Ocean in the deep, as in a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33.7. And gathered the Waters of the Sea together in a heap! That hath ſtinted the proud Waves thereof, and bounded their ſwelling rage and fury! <hi>Job</hi> 38.11. What a Power is it that ballanceth the Clouds, and uſeth them as a Swadling-band, to wrap up and hold in the Waters over our Heads, that they are not rent under ſuch a mighty Load! <hi>Job</hi> 38.9. It would amaze and even confound the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Man, ſeriouſly to think, how ſuch a vaſt Body as the Sun, that's 166 times bigger than the Earth, ſhould go over the whole Circle of the Heavens, in the ſpace of 24 Hours:
<note place="margin">The Sun is ſaid to move every Hour 1038442 of Miles.</note> that is one Million of Miles every Hour: which being ſo incredible to Mans underſtanding, late Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have found out a new way, and would have the Earth move about, and the Heavens to ſtand ſtill, which if it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet muſt be the effect of an infinite Power: It's the deſcription that's uſually given of a wiſe Man, That he is one that wonders at nothing, becauſe they ſuppoſe Ignorance to be the Cauſe of wonder: And therefore the more we know and underſtand any thing, the leſs we wonder at it: But yet for all this, I may take the boldneſs to ſay, That he is a wiſe Man indeed, that wonders not at every thing: Eſpecially if he be one that hath Wit enough to ſee the impregnable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that ſtand in the way, and hinder a diſtinct and perfect underſtanding of any the leaſt of God's Works.</p>
                  <p>And this is another Confideration, that will

As all things were made for his uſe and ſervice, ſo they were given into his hand to diſpoſe of; And they had no power to croſs his Command, or diſobey, till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt his Maker. They were all ready at his ſervice, to go and come at his beck, and to execute his pleaſure to their utmoſt ſtrength and capacity: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. <hi>And God bleſſed them,</hi> (that is <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve) and ſaid to them, Be fruitful,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:134641:254"/>and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth, and ſubdue it, and have dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth.</hi> See alſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19, 20. And Man wanted not the Faculty to diſcern the Nature and Vertue of every Creature, and for what uſes they might ſerve: Yea, the Inferiour Heavens were made to accommodate him, and every way God dealt with him as a <hi>Bountiful Lord,</hi> and moſt <hi>Liberal Benefactour:</hi> The Sun was made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten him, and the Heavens to chear him, and make the Earth fruitful with their Influences, which was to bring him forth its various Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for his ſeveral uſes and occaſions: And who, that hath the Heart of a Man, and not of a Beaſt, can think of ſuch Munificence and Bounty, which God hath exerciſed towards him, and not abhor ingratitude? And even feel himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the Praiſes of his ſo great Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he had undone himſelf, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved his Soul and Body in Miſery unſpeakable, the Lord did not utterly forſake him, (as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but he ſet his Wiſdom a work, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way, how to ſalve the honour of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and yet ſave the miſerable Rebels from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; When we were all fallen ſhort of the Glory of God, he found out a Method to recover us into Happineſs again: And when no Creature in Heaven or Earth, could do ſuch a Favour for us, the Son of God became Man and dyed for us, that he might ſatisfie offended Juſtice, and vindicate the honour both of the Law, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and procure Terms of Peace and Favour
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:134641:255"/>for us: O what a <hi>Remarkable Sentence</hi> is that, which ſhould be engraven upon the Heart of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinner: <hi>When we were without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5.6. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying indeed, and worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (1. higheſt and moſt thankful entertainment) <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.9, 10. We had been now bound hand and foot, and ſhut up in outward darkneſs, and had been Fuel to the Wrath of God, and the Flames of Hell, which are kindled thereby, and had been tormenting our Souls with the bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our ſin, who are, or may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with the bleſſed Tydings of the Goſpel. What a comfortable Thought ſhould it be to us, when we lye down, and when we riſe up, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>that Chriſt is riſen from the dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20. To underſtand which Text of Scripture, it's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we be informed, that ſin having brought a Curſe upon Man, and upon the Earth, for his ſake, and all the Fruit it brought forth, the Sacrifice of the Firſt-Fruits among the <hi>Jews,</hi> (to which the Apoſtle here alludes) was appointed by God as a Means whereby the whole Harveſt might be ſanctified and ſecured, and the Curſe removed; Which Firſt-Fruits were a Type of Chriſt, by whoſe death, the ſting of death is taken out, and by whoſe Reſurrection ours is ſecured, even the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Life, to all his true and faithful Members: And as the Firſt-Fruits were (as it were) the Pledge and Earneſt of the Harveſt, that was to follow after, ſo the Reſurrection of Chriſt is the Gage and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ours.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Having not ſpared his Son, but given him a ranſome for us, he hath with him given us all other things, we receive Mercies without number from him every day: And that 1. <hi>Privative,</hi> in guarding us from the many Miſchiefs that the deſert of our ſin, and the deſire and endeavour of our Enemies would bring upon us: And 2. <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> in beſtowing on us the good things which we deſerve not, and which the malice of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would keep from us: How many dangers have we oft-times eſcaped, which we have both known and feared, but they are far more that we have eſcaped, which we have neither known nor feared? We ſee not the Enemies that lurk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually about our Paths and Beds, and that are always plotting and endeavouring to devour us, which the ſecret Power of one that's ſtronger than they hath hitherto prevented: How oft hath Satan thirſted for our Blood, and deſired to ſift us as Wheat, But Chriſt hath interceded for us, and infatuated all his Counſels that they have not proſpered hitherto: When he hath dug low, to hide his Counſel from the Lord, and laid his deſign deep, and covered it with the greateſt cunning and ſecreſie, when he hath thought certainly now he ſhould prevail, and ſwallow us up, he hath miſs'd his purpoſe, and gone away diſappointed, and God hath ſhewed us a way how to eſcape. Every Beam of Light that ſhineth on us, every Breath we fetch, every Minutes Health we do enjoy, every Bit we eat and are refreſhed with, the Houſe that covereth us, the Air that we ſuck in, the Bed we lye on, the Friends that comfort us, every Sweetneſs that we taſt, either in the Acts
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:134641:256"/>of Senſe or Underſtanding, together with the continuance of all our Faculties; In a word, every Comfort that befriendeth us, is a diſtinct Mercy of God, vouchſafed to us in Jeſus Chriſt. What ſhall I ſay? How numberleſs are theſe which I have but generally touched? If I ſhould inſiſt upon the ſeveral Circumſtances and Degrees of them, with the frequent Repetition of every one of them: But theſe are not the one half of what our Redeemer doth beſtow: The Mercies that concern our Souls are far more numberleſs: So that though I have ſeemed to name but three or four Inſtances of the Bounty of God towards us, yet theſe are all ſo comprehenſive, (eſpecially thoſe of Creation, Redemption, and Providence) that they contain more under them, than can be reckoned up in the Individuals, by any humane Art or Skill: There are ſome few of thoſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ways, whereby God's goodneſs is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to us. I might further ſhew, how much the goodneſs of God is manifeſt towards us in all our Sufferings, Streights, Neceſſities, Afflictions, Sickneſs, Death, which breed the only quarrel between us and the goodneſs of the Lord, and will not let us ſpeak out and acknowledge it freely, as we ought: It's eaſie to vindicate the goodneſs of the Lord even in theſe, to ſuch as will but bring an impartial ear.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth his Wiſdom and Power towards us, come much behind his goodneſs: Doth it not require infinite Wiſdom and Power, to govern ſuch a perverſe piece as ſin hath made Man to be? And to make him ſerviceable, either willingly, or without his Will, to the glorious Ends of Order
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:134641:256"/>and Government in the World? And that both in his Commerce 1. with God, 2. with Men, 3. with other Creatures; either bridling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering his Corruptions, (without any impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his liberty) that they do not confound and deſtroy all Piety, Juſtice, and Sobriety out of the World: It muſt be no leſs than the Power of God, that muſt bring down the Proud, that would otherwiſe trample all under feet; That muſt govern the Savage Nations, and tame and reſtrain the barbarous and bloody minds, and make the wretched devices of the Enemies of his Church to be of none effect: It muſt be a mighty Power indeed, that muſt turn a furious, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Saul,</hi> into an humble, penitent, and faithful <hi>Saul:</hi> What a wiſdom is ſeen, in making Man ſo great, and yet ſo little? in deſigning him for ſo high an end, and yet training him up for it by ſuch low and deſpicable means? But I will run out no further on this Argument, leſt I find no end.</p>
